<h2 id="Preface">Preface</h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE love of precious stones is deeply implanted in
the human heart, and the cause of this must be
sought not only in their coloring and brilliancy but also
in their durability. All the fair colors of flowers and
foliage, and even the blue of the sky and the glory of the
sunset clouds, only last for a short time, and are subject
to continual change, but the sheen and coloration of
precious stones are the same to-day as they were thousands
of years ago and will be for thousands of years
to come. In a world of change, this permanence has a
charm of its own that was early appreciated.</p>

<p>The object of this book is to indicate and illustrate
the various ways in which precious stones have been
used at different times and among different peoples, and
more especially to explain some of the curious ideas and
fancies that have gathered around them. Many of these
ideas may seem strange enough to us now, and yet when
we analyze them we find that they have their roots either
in some intrinsic quality of the stones or else in an instinctive
appreciation of their symbolical significance.
Through manifold transformations this symbolism has
persisted to the present day.</p>

<p>The same thing may be said in regard to the various
superstitions connected with gems. Our scientific knowledge
of cause and effect may prevent us from accepting
any of the fanciful notions of the physicians and astrologers
of the olden time; nevertheless, the possession
of a necklace or a ring adorned with brilliant diamonds,
fair pearls, warm, glowing rubies, or celestial-hued
sapphires will to-day make a woman’s heart beat faster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
and bring a blush of pleasure to her cheek. Life will
seem better worth living to her; and, indeed, this is no
delusion, for life is what our thought makes it, and joy
is born of gratified desire. Hence nothing that contributes
to increasing the sum of innocent pleasures
should be disdained; and surely no pleasure can be more
innocent and justifiable than that inspired by the possession
of beautiful natural objects.</p>

<p>The author, who possesses what is believed to be the
most comprehensive private library on this subject, has
obtained many references from material which he has
been gathering during the past twenty-five years. Many
of the types exist in the collection of folk-lore precious
stones exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in
1893, and now in the Field Museum of Natural History
in Chicago. Other types are drawn from the Morgan Collection
exhibited at the Paris Expositions of 1889 and
1900, which, with additions, is now in Morgan Hall, in the
American Museum of Natural History, New York City.</p>

<p>Other prominent references are the collection of precious
stones in the California Midwinter Memorial
Museum, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco; the
Tiffany collection of precious stones, exhibited at the
Atlanta Exposition of 1894, now in the National Museum
in Washington; the collection exhibited at the Pan-American
Exposition, and presented to the Musée
d’Histoire Naturelle, in Paris, by the late J. Pierpont
Morgan; the collection exhibited at the exposition held
in Portland, Oregon, in 1905; and the collection of gems
and precious stones exhibited at the Jamestown Exposition,
1907. All of these collections, either entirely
or very largely, have been formed by the author.</p>

<p>Some references to sentiment connected with precious
stones are embodied in the little work, now in its 21st<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
edition, entitled: “Natal Stones, Sentiments and Superstitions
Associated with Precious Stones,” compiled by
the writer, who has examined nearly all the principal collections
in the United States, Europe, Mexico, Canada, and
Asiatic Russia.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a><br />

<small>Superstitions and Their Sources</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">FROM the earliest times in man’s history gems and
precious stones have been held in great esteem.
They have been found in the monuments of prehistoric
peoples, and not alone the civilization of the Pharaohs,
of the Incas, or of the Montezumas invested these brilliant
things from Nature’s jewel casket with a significance
beyond the mere suggestion of their intrinsic
properties.</p>

<p>The magi, the wise men, the seers, the astrologers of
the ages gone by found much in the matter of gems that
we have nearly come to forgetting. With them each gem
possessed certain planetary attractions peculiar to itself,
certain affinities with the various virtues, and a zodiacal
concordance with the seasons of the year. Moreover,
these early sages were firm believers in the influence of
gems in one’s nativity,—that the evil in the world could
be kept from contaminating a child properly protected
by wearing the appropriate talismanic, natal, and
zodiacal gems. Indeed, folklorists are wont to wonder
whether the custom of wearing gems in jewelry did not
originate in the talismanic idea instead of in the idea of
mere additional adornment.</p>

<p>The influence exerted by precious stones was assumed
in medieval times without question, but when the spirit
of investigation was aroused in the Renaissance period,
an effort was made to find a reason of some sort for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
traditional beliefs. Strange as it may seem to us, there
was little disposition to doubt that the influence existed;
this was taken for granted, and all the mental effort
expended was devoted to finding some plausible explanation
as to how precious stones became endowed with their
strange and mystic virtues, and how these virtues acted
in modifying the character, health, or fortunes of the
wearer.</p>

<p>When the existence of miracles is acknowledged, there
will always be a tendency to regard every singular and
unaccountable happening as a miracle; that is to say,
as something that occurs outside of, or in spite of, the
laws of nature. We even observe this tendency at work
in our own time. As regards visual impressions, for instance,
if a child of lively imagination enters a half-lighted
room and sees a bundle of clothes lying in a
corner, the indistinct outline of this mass may be transformed
to his mind into the form of a wild animal. The
child does not really see an animal, but his fear has given
a definite outline and character to the indefinite image
printed on the retina.</p>

<p>The writer has always sought to investigate anything
strange and apparently unaccountable which has been
brought to his notice, but he can truly say he has never
found the slightest evidence of anything transcending
the acknowledged laws of nature. Still, when we consider
the marvellous secrets that have been revealed to
us by science and the yet more wonderful things that
will be revealed to us in the future, we are tempted to
think that there may be something in the old beliefs,
some residuum of fact, susceptible indeed of explanation,
but very different from what a crass scepticism
supposes it to be. Above all, the results of the investigations
now pursued in relation to the group of phe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>nomena
embraced under the designation of telepathy,—the
subconscious influence of one mind over an absent or
distant mind,—and the wireless transmission of power
in wireless telegraphy and telephony, may go far to make
us hesitate before condemning as utterly preposterous
many of the tales of enchantment and magical influence.
If the unconscious will of one individual can affect the
thoughts and feelings of another individual at a great
distance and without the intervention of any known
means of communication, as is confidently asserted by
many competent investigators in the domain of telepathy,
their claims being supported by many strange
happenings, perhaps the result of coincidence, but possibly
due to the operation of some unknown law, does
this not give a color of verity to the statements regarding
the ancient magicians and their spells?</p>

<p>Auto-suggestion may also afford an explanation of
much that is mysterious in the effects attributed to
precious stones, for if the wearer be firmly convinced
that the gem he is wearing produces certain results, this
conviction will impress itself upon his thought and hence
upon his very organism. He will really experience the
influence, and the effects will manifest themselves just
as powerfully as though they were caused by vibrations
or emanations from the material body of the stone.</p>

<p>All this may serve to explain the persistence of the
belief in magic arts. A few hundred years ago, a Hungarian
woman was accused of having murdered two or
three hundred young girls, and at her trial she confessed
that her object was to use the blood of her victims to
renew her youth and beauty, for the blood of innocent
virgins was supposed to have wonderful properties. In
some parts of England today there is a superstitious
belief that an article of clothing worn by a person, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
anything he has habitually used, absorbs a portion of
his individuality. Therefore, it sometimes happens that
a handkerchief, for instance, will be stolen and pinned
down beneath the waters of a stream on a toad, the pins
marking the name of the enemy, the belief being that as
this cloth wastes away, so will the body of him who had
worn it. In medieval and later times this was the common
practice of the sorcerers, although they frequently composed
a wax figure rudely resembling the person against
whom the spell was directed, and then thrust pins into
this figure or allowed it to melt away before a slow fire.
The enchantment of the sorcerer was supposed to have
caused some essence of the personality to enter into the
image, and therefore the living and breathing being felt
sympathetically the effects of the ill-treatment inflicted
upon its counterfeit.</p>

<p>The persistence of the most cruel and unnatural practices
of old-time sorcery is illustrated by the fact that
only a few years ago, in the island of Cuba, three women
were condemned to death for murdering a white baby
so as to use the heart and blood as a cure for diseases.
Four other women were sentenced to from fourteen to
twenty years’ imprisonment as accomplices. When such
things happen in Cuba, it is not surprising that in half-civilized
Hayti similar crimes are committed. Here the
Voodoo priests and priestesses, <i lang="cpf">papalois</i> and <i lang="cpf">mamalois</i>
(papa-kings and mama-queens) require from time to
time a human sacrifice to appease their serpent-god. One
strange case is related where a stupefying potion, inducing
a state of apparent death, was secretly administered
to a sick man. When the attending physician pronounced
him dead, he was duly interred; but, two days
after, the grave was found open and the body had disappeared.
The Voodoo worshippers had carried the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
away so as to revive him and then sacrifice him at their
fearful rites.</p>

<p>In a poem addressed to Marguerite de Valois,—“La
Marguerite des Marguerites,” as she was called,—by
Jean de la Taille de Bondaroy,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> we read of the diamond
that it came from gold and from the sun. But we are
told that not only are precious stones endowed with life,
they also are subject to disease, old age, and death;
“they even take offence if an injury be done to them, and
become rough and pale.” The sickness of the pearl has
been a theme for centuries, and in many cases is only
fancied. It is but a subterfuge or deception for a lady
to remark that her pearls have sickened; by referring to
this sickness, her friends are naturally led to believe that
at one time her pearls were fine, perfect ones, when in
reality they may never have been so.</p>

<p>The opinion given in 1609, by Anselmus De Boot,
court physician to Rudolph II of Germany, regarding the
power inherent in certain precious stones,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> embodies the
ideas on this subject held by many of the enlightened
minds of that period.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The supernatural and acting cause is God, the good angel and the
evil one; the good by the will of God, and the evil by His permission....
What God can do by Himself, He could do also by means of
ministers, good and bad angels, who, by special grace of God and for
the preservation of men, are enabled to enter precious stones and to
guard men from dangers or procure some special grace for them.
However, as we may not affirm anything positive touching the presence
of angels in gems, to repose trust in them, or to ascribe undue powers
to them, is more especially pleasing to the spirit of evil, who transforms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
himself into an angel of light, steals into the substance of the little
gem, and works such wonders by it that some people do not place
their trust in God but in a gem, and seek to obtain from it what they
should ask of God alone. Thus it is perhaps the spirit of evil which
exercises its power on us through the turquoise, teaching us, little by
little, that safety is not to be sought from God but from a gem.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the next chapter of his work, De Boot, while extolling
the remedial power of a certain group of stones,
insists upon the falsity of many of the superstitions
regarding these objects.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>That gems or stones, when applied to the body, exert an action
upon it, is so well proven by the experience of many persons, that
any one who doubts this must be called over-bold. We have proof
of this power in the carnelian, the hematite, and the jasper, all of
which when applied, check hemorrhage.... However, it is very
necessary to observe that many virtues not possessed by gems are
falsely ascribed to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Paracelsus, the gifted and brilliant thinker, scientist,
and, we must probably add, charlatan of the sixteenth
century, whose really extraordinary mental endowment
was largely wasted in the effort to impress his followers
with the idea that he had a mystic control over supernatural
agencies, was the owner of a talismanic jewel
which he asserted to be the dwelling-place of a powerful
spirit named “Azoth.” Some old portraits of the
philosopher, or pseudo-philosopher, figure him wearing
this jewel, in whose virtues we may fairly doubt that he
himself believed, but which furnished part of the paraphernalia
be freely employed to gain influence over the
credulous.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The following passage from the “Faithful Lapidary”
of Thomas Nicols,<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> who wrote in the middle of the seventeenth
century, illustrates the prevailing opinion in England
at that time as to the virtues of precious stones:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i lang="la">Perfectionem effectûs contineri in causa.</i> But it cannot truly be
so spoken of gemms and precious stones, the effects of which, by
Lapidists are said to be, the making of men rich and eloquent, to
preserve men from thunder and lightning, from plagues and diseases,
to move dreams, to procure sleep, to foretell things to come, to make
men wise, to strengthen memory, to procure honours, to hinder fascinations
and witchcrafts, to hinder slothfulness, to put courage into
men, to keep men chaste, to increase friendship, to hinder difference
and dissention, and to make men invisible, as is feigned by the Poet
concerning Gyges ring, and affirmed by Albertus and others concerning
the <i lang="la">ophthalmius lapis</i>, and many other strange things are affirmed of
them and ascribed to them, which are contrary to the nature of gemms,
and which they as they are materiall, mixt, inanimate bodies neither
know nor can effect, by the properties and faculties of their own constitutions:
because they being naturall causes, can produce none other
but naturall effects, such as are all the ordinary effects of gemms:
that is, such effects as flow from their elementary matter, from their
temper, form and essence; such as are the operations of hot and cold,
and of all the first qualities, and all such accidents as do arise from the
commixtion of the first qualities: such as are hardnesse, heavinesse,
thicknesse, colour, and tast. These all are the naturall faculties of
gemms, and these are the known effects of the union of their matter,
and of the operation of the first qualities one upon another.</p></blockquote>

<p>The long-continued concentration of vision on an
object tends to produce a partial paralysis of certain
functions of the brain. This effect may be noted in the
helplessness of a bird when its gaze is fixed upon the
glittering eyes of a serpent, or in the unwilling obedience
yielded by a lion or some other wild animal when forced
to look into the intent eyes of its trainer. In the same
way those who gaze for a long time and without inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>ruption
on a crystal or glass ball, on an opal, a moonstone,
a sapphire, or a cat’s-eye, may become partially
hypnotized or even fall into a profound sleep. The condition
induced, whether it be that of semi-trance, of hypnotism,
or simply due to the imaginative workings of
the brain, is believed to give an insight into the future.
This hypnotic effect is probably caused by some gleam
or point of light in the stone, attracting and fixing the
beholder’s gaze. The moonstone, the star sapphire, and
the cat’s-eye are all gems which possess a moving light,
a moving line, or three crossed lines, and they are believed
by the Orientals to be gems of good luck. Indeed, it is
supposed in the East that a living spirit dwells within
these stones, a spirit potent for good.</p>

<p>Superstitious fancies bear the same relation to truth
that the shadow of a form does to the form itself. We
know that the shadow has no substantial existence, and
yet we know equally well that it is cast by some real body;
in the same way we may be sure that, however foolish
a superstition may appear to be, it has some foundation
in fact. Indeed, superstition is associated with the
highest attribute of the human mind,—imagination. The
realities about us gain much of their charm from sentiment,
and all that is great in art and literature owes its
being to the transforming energy of pure imagination.
Morbid imagination, on the other hand, distorts and
degrades the impressions it receives and produces only
unlovely or ignoble forms and ideas.</p>

<p>Sentiment may best be expressed as the feeling of
one who, on a warm summer’s day, is rowing along a
shady brook or resting in some sylvan dell, with nothing
to interfere with his tranquil mood and nothing to spur
him on to action; thus he has only suggestions of hope
and indulges in rosy views of life. Reality, on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
hand, may be likened to a crisp winter’s morning when
one is filled with exhilaration, conscious of the tingle of
the cold, but comfortable in the knowledge of wearing a
tightly-buttoned garment which will afford protection
should the elements become disturbing. Superstition,
lastly, can be said to resemble a dark, cold, misty night,
when the moon is throwing malevolent shadows which
are weird and distorted, while the cold seems to seize
one by the throat and arouse a passionate desire to free
one’s self from its grip in some way, to change a horrible
nightmare into a pleasant dream.</p>

<p>In the early part of the last century a series of very
interesting experiments designed to demonstrate the
effects produced upon a sensitive subject by the touch of
precious stones and minerals, were made in the case of
the “Seeress of Prevorst,” Frederike Hauffe (b. 1801),
a woman believed to possess remarkable clairvoyant
powers.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> When pieces of granite, porphyry, or flint were
placed in her hand, she was not affected in any way. The
finest qualities of fluorspar, on the other hand, had a
marked action, relaxing the muscles, causing diarrhœa,
and producing a sour taste in the mouth; occasionally a
somnambulistic state was induced. This latter condition
was also produced by Iceland spar and by the sapphire.
While the substances so far noted depressed the vital
energy, sulphate of barium stimulated the muscles,
produced an agreeable warmth of the body, and made
the subject feel as though she could fly through the
air. If the application of this material was long continued,
the pleasurable sensation found expression in
laughter. In the case of witherite, a carbonate of barium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
this effect was produced to an even greater degree, for
if water in which this mineral had been dipped were
swallowed, spasms of laughter resulted.</p>

<p>Rock-crystal also was found to possess a strongly
stimulating influence, for if put in the hand, it aroused
the subject from a half-slumber, and if placed on the pit
of the stomach, it had the power to awaken the seeress
from a somnambulistic trance, while at the same time an
aromatic odor was diffused around. When, however,
the application was continued for some time, the muscles
stiffened, until finally an epileptic state ensued. Indeed,
the rigidity produced was so great that the limbs
resisted all attempts to bend them. The same effect, but
in a much less degree, was caused by glass, even by looking
at it, or by the tones emitted by a glass object when
struck. All colorless silicates, the diamond, and even
gypsum, had a similar effect, as did also heliotrope and
basalt, either of which caused a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>

<p>The most powerful action was that exerted by hematite,
the oxide of iron in this substance inducing a kind
of paralysis, with a sensation of inner chill; this condition
could only be relieved by the application of a piece
of witherite. Octahedrons of magnetite (loadstone)
caused a sensation of heaviness and convulsive movements
of the limbs, even when the material, wrapped up
in paper, was brought near the subject. Spinel, in whose
composition oxide of chromium enters, caused the same
symptoms as loadstone, except that in this case the force
seemed to exert itself from the hand upward along the
arm, while with the loadstone the action was downward
along the arm to the hand, owing to the attractive quality
of this magnetic iron. Ruby called forth a sensation of
coldness in the tongue, and rendered this member so
heavy that only incoherent sounds could be emitted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the fingers and toes also became cold, and the body was
agitated by a violent shivering; but to all these bad symptoms
succeeded a sense of elasticity and well-being, not,
however, without a vague fear that the stone might cause
a renewal of the physical depression. When chrysoprase
was used, chills and shivering resulted, beginning at the
breast and spreading thence over the whole body.</p>

<p>We have touched upon the hypnotic influence exercised
by gems, but there can be no doubt that the subject
has not been as carefully studied as it deserves to be.
That the hypnotic state can be induced by gazing fixedly
upon a bright object held just above the eyes is a well-known
fact, but quite probably a similar though not so
pronounced effect results from gazing on a bright object
just before the gazer’s eyes. In the case of colored
precious stones, the effects of the various color-rays combine
with the light effects and strengthen the impression
upon the optic nerve. All this, however, concerns only
the purely physical impression, but we know that very
often the hypnotic state is produced by a mental impression,
by the belief, or the fear, that the state will supervene.
With precious stones as hypnotizing agents, the
mental impression is widely different, for here the physical
impression is heightened by the consciousness of the
value and rarity of the material. The fascination that a
fine set of jewels, with all their sparkle and color, exercises
upon the mind of a woman who sees them in their
glorious radiance on the neck, the arms, and the head of
another woman, is not only due to the beauty of the
spectacle, but is largely owing to the consciousness that
they are rare and valuable objects and are perhaps
eloquent witnesses of the power of love. A dash of envy
sometimes serves to render the emotion more complex.</p>

<p>The names of precious stones and semi-precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
stones are frequently used as adjectives, and when so
employed convey something more to the mind than do the
corresponding adjectives of color. We may instance the
following expressions: the “Emerald Isle” and “emerald
meadows”; “sapphire seas” and “sapphire eyes”;
“ruby wine,” “ruby lips,” and, in Shakespeare, “the
natural ruby of your cheeks”; “coral lips” and “coral
ears”; “pearly teeth” and “pearly skin”; “turquoise
skies”; “amethystine locks” and, in Roman times,
“amber hair.” In all these cases the name of the precious
mineral is really used as a superlative of the adjective,
suggesting the choicest variety of the color or shade.
The phrases “hard as adamant” and “clear as crystal”
show a similar use of the name of a precious or ornamental
stone to express the highest grade of a given
quality.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the “point” system in
typography three of the grades of type bore the names
of precious stones,—namely, “diamond type,” “agate
type,” and “emerald type”; this latter designation is
employed only in England, where “agate type” is called
“ruby type.” Another size was denominated “pearl
type.”</p>

<p>A fanciful tale written not long ago treats of the
practical inconveniences which would result, could such
metaphorical expressions find a realization in fact.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> At
the birth-feast of a certain princess, one of the fairies
was not invited; she, nevertheless, made her appearance.
After the other fairies had endowed the child with many
good qualities, the neglected fairy said, “I will give her
vanity, and her vanity shall change her beauty to the
things it is said to resemble.” However, a friendly fairy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
came to the rescue, saying, “I will give her unselfishness,
and by it she shall turn her beauty back to what she
wishes it to be.”</p>

<p>The result can easily be imagined. As the little
princess grew up, those who wished to flatter her vanity
spoke of her “teeth of pearl,” of her “golden hair,” of
her “coral lips,” and of her “sapphire eyes.” Upon this
her teeth changed to pearls, her hair to spun gold, her
lips to coral, and her eyes to two magnificent sapphires.
However, beautiful as these were, they did not grant the
power of sight, so that the unhappy princess became
blind. Not long after this a revolution deprived the king
and queen of their throne and they were reduced to great
poverty. In these straits the daughter sacrificed her
“gold-hair” to relieve their wants, and immediately
the spell was dissolved and she regained all her natural
beauty.</p>

<p>Shelley, who saw the world illumined by the rainbow
hues of poetic fancy, wrote of “diamond eyes,” “an
emerald sky,” “the emerald heaven of trees,” “the sapphire
ocean,” “sapphire-tinted skies,” “the sapphire
floods of interstellar air,” and “the chrysolite of sunrise.”
For some reason, he does not use the ruby, a
favorite stone with many poets, and psychologists might
find in this a proof that red appeals less strongly to the
idealist than do the other colors.</p>

<p>The principal literary sources for the talismanic and
therapeutic virtues attributed to ornamental stones may
be divided into several groups, at first more or less independent
of each other, but combined to a greater or lesser
extent by later writers. Pliny gives, sometimes rather
grudgingly, a number of superstitions current in his time,
but the Alexandrian literature of the second, third, and
fourth Christian centuries provides a much richer field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
for these superstitions, as shown in the Orphic poem
“Lithica,” the “Cyrianides,” attributed to Hermes
Trismegistus, the little treatise “On Rivers,” which bore
the name of Plutarch, and last, but not least, in the work
by Damigeron, which purported to be written by an Arab
king named Evax, and sent by him to Tiberius or Nero.
The influence exerted by the legends surrounding the
stones of the high priest’s breastplate, and those chosen
as foundation stones for the New Jerusalem, will be
treated of elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, a new
literature on this subject made its appearance, probably
in Asia Minor. Some of the works were originally
written in Syriac and later translated into Arabic.
Others were composed in the latter language. This
source was drawn upon for the production of the Lapidarium
of Alfonso X, of Castile. This compilation,
although dating in its present Spanish form from the
thirteenth century, is based upon a much older original
in “Chaldee” (Syriac?). There can be little doubt that
many Hindu superstitions, no longer preserved for us in
the literature of India, are reproduced in these Syrio-Arabic
works, wherein we have also much that is of
Alexandrian origin. This indeed is easily explained by
history, for the Arabs, through their widely extended
conquests, were led to absorb and amalgamate the data
they secured, directly or indirectly, from the East and
the West.</p>

<p>While this literature was developing in the Mohammedan
world, the tradition of Pliny and Solinus was
transmitted to the Christian world of the seventh and
succeeding centuries by Isidorus of Seville. This brings
us to the remarkable poetical treatise on the virtues of
precious stones by Marbodus, Bishop of Rennes, a work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
written at the end of the eleventh century, and often
quoted as that of Evax; indeed, it purports to be by him
and really contains a good part of the material composing
the treatise of Damigeron or Evax. At the same
time Marbodus drew freely upon Pliny, either directly
or through Isidorus. For the Middle Ages this poem of
Marbodus, already translated into Old French in the
twelfth century, became known as the “Lapidario” <i lang="fr">par
excellence</i>, and furnished a
great part of their material to
medieval authors on this subject.
Soon, however, extracts
from the Arabic sources became
available, and the whole
mass of heterogeneous material
was worked over and
recombined in a variety of
ways.</p>

</div>

<p>This complex origin of the
traditions explains their almost
incomprehensible contradictions
regarding the virtues assigned
to the different stones,
and also the fact that the
qualities of one stone are frequently
attributed to another one, so that, in the later
works on this subject, it becomes quite impossible to present
a satisfactory view of the distinguishing qualities
and virtues of the separate stones. The habit of copying,
without discrimination or criticism, whatever came to
hand, and the aim to utilize as much of the borrowed material
as possible, is scarcely less a characteristic of the
seventeenth and eighteenth century writers than it is of
those of a later date. This is in part an excusable and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
even an unavoidable defect, but it should be minimized as
much as possible.</p>

<p>The treatise known under the title “Cyrianides” was,
as we have noted, a product of the Alexandrian school.
It was asserted to be the work of Hermes Trismegistus,
the name given by the Greeks to the Egyptian god Thoth.
Here we have a specimen of
the species of magic known as
litteromancy, or divination by
means of the letters of the
alphabet, since a stone, a bird,
a plant, and a fish, each beginning
with the same letter and
signifying the four elements,
are given for each of the
twenty-four letters of the Greek
alphabet. These four objects
were to be grouped together to
form a talisman, the bird being
usually engraved on the stone,
while a portion of the fish and
of the plant was placed in the
bezel of the ring in which the
stone was to be set.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Another,
almost contemporary work, is
the exceedingly curious and interesting
treatise by St. Epiphanius, Bishop of Constantia,
on the twelve gems on the “Breastplate of Judgment”
of the high priest (Ex., xxviii, 15-21). This unique
production is in the form of a letter addressed to Diodorus,
Bishop of Tyre, and it is peculiarly valuable as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
first of a long series of attempts to elucidate the question
as to the identity of the twelve stones. The special virtues
of each stone are also given, and this treatise may be
regarded as the prototype of all the Christian writings
on the symbolism of stones.</p>

<p>A most interesting medieval treatise on the virtues
of precious stones forms part of the <i lang="la">De rerum natura</i> of
Thomas de Cantimpré (1201-1270), who was a pupil of
Albertus Magnus and composed his
work between 1230 and 1244. The
Latin text has never been printed,
but the book was translated into
German by Konrad von Megenberg
about 1350. Strange to say, the
translator did not know the name of
the writer and supposed when he
began to translate the book that it
was by Albertus Magnus. In many
cases Thomas de Cantimpré merely
copies the statements of older authors,
but occasionally he gives us
new material, or at least a new version
of his originals.</p>

</div>


<p>The renowned medieval philosopher
and theologian, Albertus
Magnus (1193-1280), for a short time Bishop of Ratisbon,
and who later taught theology in the University of
Paris and had the great St. Thomas Aquinas for a pupil,
was not altogether free from the superstitious notions
of his time, traces of which appear in certain of his
numerous writings. Many years after his death some
of this material was extracted from his works and,
amplified by additions from other sources, was published
under the title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> “Secrets des vertus des Herbes, Pierres
et Bestes.” Of this there are two versions, one being
an epitome of the other and termed respectively “Le
Grand Albert” and “Le Petit Albert.” These little
books were often reprinted and widely circulated, and
eventually enjoyed great popularity among the French
peasants. Indeed, even to the present day they may
still be met with in out-of-the-way parts of rural France.</p>

<p>Among literary deceptions one of the boldest was that
practised in the early part of the seventeenth century by
Ludovico Dolce. This writer made, in 1565, a literal
translation into Italian of the “Speculum lapidum” of
Camillo Leonardo, printed in Venice in 1502, and he had
the courage to issue it as his own work, under the
title “Trattato delle gemme chè produce la natura.” In
view of the general familiarity with Latin among the
better classes at that period, and the numerous fine
libraries existing in Venice at the time, it seems most
extraordinary that Dolce should have been successful in
palming off this work as his own, but even to-day citations
are made from Dolce’s “Trattato delle gemme”
and from Leonardo’s “Speculum lapidum,” as though
these were distinct works.</p>

<small>On the Use of Precious and Semi-Precious Stones
as Talismans and Amulets</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE use of precious stones in early times as amulets
and talismans is shown in many ancient records,
and several scholars have assumed that the belief in the
magic efficacy of stones gave rise to their use as objects
of personal adornment. It is, of course, very difficult
either to prove or to disprove such a theory, for, even
in the case of the oldest texts, we must bear in mind that
they do not in the least represent primitive conditions,
and that many thousands of years must have elapsed
before a people could attain the grade of civilization
necessary for the production of even the simplest literature.
For this reason, certain investigators have preferred
to seek for a solution of this problem in the customs
and habits of the so-called uncivilized peoples of
our own time; but we must not forget that conditions
which seem to us very rudimentary are, nevertheless, the
result of a long process of development. Even if this
development was arrested many centuries or millenniums
ago, it must have required a very considerable period of
time to evolve such usages and conventions as are found
even among the lowest races. Indeed, many uncivilized
peoples have very complicated rules and observances,
testifying to considerable thought and reflection.</p>

<p>Fetichism in all its forms depends upon an imperfect
conception of what constitutes life and conscious being,
so that will and thought are attributed to inanimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
objects. We can observe this in the case of animals and
very young children, who regard any moving object as
endowed with life. In the case of stones, however, it
seems probable that those supposed to be the abode of
spirits, good or evil, were selected because their natural
form suggested that of some animal or of some portion
of the human body. On the other hand, the wearing of
what we call precious stones is more likely to have been
due to the attraction exercised by bright colors upon
the eye of the beholder and to the desire to display some
distinguishing mark that would command attention and
admiration for the wearer. This tendency runs through
the higher animal kingdom, and its workings have served
as a foundation for the theory of natural selection.</p>

<p>It seems likely that we have here the true explanation
of the motive for the gathering, preserving, and wearing
of precious stones. Since these objects are motionless,
they can scarcely have impressed the mind of primitive
man with the idea that they were alive; they were not
imposing by their mass, as were large stones, and their
crystalline form scarcely figured any known living shape.
Hence their chief, we may even say their only attraction
was their color and brilliancy. What effect these
qualities had upon the visual sense of primitive man
may be safely inferred from the effect such objects produce
upon infants. The baby has no fear in regard to a
small and brilliantly colored object which is shown to it,
but will eagerly put out its hand to seize, hold, and gaze
upon a bright-colored stone. As the object is quite passive
and easily handled, there is nothing to suggest any
lurking power to harm, and therefore there is nothing to
interfere with the pleasurable sensation aroused in the
optic nerve by the play of color. In this naïve admiration
of what is brilliant and colored, the infant undoubtedly
represents for us the mental attitude of primitive
man.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Probably the first objects chosen for personal adornment
were those easily strung or bound together,—for
instance, certain perforated shells and brilliant seeds;
the softer stones, wherein holes could be easily bored by
the help of the simplest tools, probably came next, while
the harder gems must have been hoarded as pretty toys
long before they could be adjusted for use as ornaments.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, when these objects had once been
worn, there was a disposition to attribute certain happenings
to their influence and power, and in this way
there arose a belief in their efficacy, and, finally, the conviction
that they were the abodes of powerful spirits. In
this, as in many other things, man’s first and instinctive
appreciation was the truest, and it has required centuries
of enlightenment to bring us back to this love of
precious stones for their esthetic beauty alone. Indeed,
even to-day, we can see the power of superstitious belief
in the case of the opal, which some timid people still
fear to wear, although until three or four centuries ago
this stone was thought to combine all the virtues of the
various colored gems, the hues of which are united in its
sparkling light.</p>

<p>A proof that bright and colored objects were attractive
in themselves, and were first gathered up and preserved
by primitive man for this reason alone, may be
found in the fact that certain birds, notable the <i>Chlamydera</i>
of Australia, related to our ravens, after constructing
for themselves pretty arbors, strew the floors with
variegated pebbles, so arranged as to suggest a mosaic
pavement. At the entrance of the arbors are heaped up
pieces of bone, shells, feathers, and stones, which have
often been brought from a considerable distance, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
giving evidence that the birds have not selected these
objects at random. It is strange that the attraction exercised
upon the sense of sight by anything brilliant
and colored, which is at the same time easily portable
and can be handled or worn, should be overlooked by
those who are disposed to assert that all ornaments of
this kind were originally selected and preserved solely
or principally because of their supposed talismanic
qualities.</p>

<p>The theory that colored and brilliant stones were first
collected by men because of their beauty rather than
because of their talismanic virtues, is corroborated by
the statement made that seals select with considerable
care the stones they swallow, and observers on the fishing
grounds have noted this and believe that pebbles of
chalcedony and serpentine found there have been brought
by the seals.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The popular derivation of the word “amulet” from
an Arabic word <i lang="ar">hamalât</i>, signifying something suspended
or worn, is not accepted by the best Arabic scholars, and
it seems probable that the name is of Latin origin, in
spite of the fact that no very satisfactory etymology can
be given. Pliny’s use of <i lang="la">amuletum</i> shows that with him
the word did not always denote an object that was worn
on the person, although this later became its meaning.
The old etymology given by Varro (118-29 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), who
derived <i lang="la">amuletum</i> from the verb <i lang="la">amoliri</i>, “to remove,”
“to drive away,” may not be quite in accord with modern
philology, but still has something to recommend it as far
as the sense goes, for the amulet was certainly believed
to hold dangers aloof, or even to remove them. Talis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>man,
however, a word not used in classical times, undoubtedly
comes from the Arabic <i lang="ar">tilsam</i>, this being in
turn derived from τέλεσμα, used in late Greek to signify
an initiation, or an incantation.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that in the earliest Stone Age
there is no trace of either idols or images; the art of this
period being entirely profane. In the later Stone Age,
however, entirely different ideas seem to have gained
the ascendancy, for a majority of the objects of plastic
art so far discovered have a religious significance. This
has evidently proceeded from the conception that every
image of a living object absorbs something of the essence
of the object itself, and this conception, while a primitive
one, still presupposes a certain degree of development.
This rule applies more especially to amulets, which were
therefore fashioned as beautifully as primitive art permitted,
that they might become fitting abodes for the
benevolent spirits believed to animate them and render
them efficacious.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>A curious idol or talisman from Houaïlou, New Caledonia,
is in the collection of Signor Giglioli. This is a
stone bearing naturally a rude resemblance to the human
form.<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> We can easily understand that such an object
was looked upon as the abode of some spirit, for similar
strange natural formations have been regarded with a
species of superstitious awe by peoples much more civilized
than the natives of New Caledonia.</p>

<p>For the Middle Ages and even down to the seventeenth
century, the talismanic virtues of precious stones
were believed in by high and low, by princes and peas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>ants,
by the learned as well as by the ignorant. Here
and there, however, a note of scepticism was sometimes
apparent, as in the famous reply of the court jester of
Emperor Charles V, to the question, “What is the property
of the turquoise?” “Why,” replied he, “if you
should happen to fall from a high tower whilst you were
wearing a turquoise on your finger, the turquoise would
remain unbroken.”</p>

<p>The doctrine of sympathy and antipathy found expression
in the belief that the very substance of certain
stones was liable to modification by the condition of
health or even by the thoughts of the wearer. In case of
sickness or approaching death the lustre of the stones
was dimmed, or else their bright colors were darkened,
and unfaithfulness or perjury produced similar phenomena.
Concerning the turquoise, the prosaic explanation
can be offered that this stone is affected to a certain
extent by the secretions of the skin; but popular superstition
saw the same phenomena in the ruby, the diamond,
and other stones not possessing the sensitiveness
of the turquoise. Hence the true explanation is to be
found in the prevailing idea that an occult sympathy
existed between stone and wearer. The sentiment underlying
the conception is well expressed by Emerson in
the following lines from “The Amulet”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Give me an amulet</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That keeps intelligence with you,—</div>
<div class="verse">Red when you love, and rosier red,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And when you love not, pale and blue.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A Persian legend of the origin of diamonds and precious
stones shows that in the East these beautiful objects
were looked upon as the source of much sin and
sorrow. We are told that when God created the world
he made no useless things, such as gold, silver, precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
stones, and diamonds; but Satan, who is always eager
to bring evil among men, kept a close watch to spy out
the appetites and passions of the human mind. To his
great satisfaction he noted that Eve passionately loved
the many-colored flowers that decked the Garden of
Eden; he therefore undertook to imitate their brightness
and color out of earth, and in this way were produced
colored precious stones and diamonds. These in after
time so strongly appealed to the greed and covetousness
of mankind that they have been the cause of much crime
and wretchedness.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The present age could afford us nearly as many examples
of faith in talismans and amulets as any epoch
in the past, if people were willing to confess their real
beliefs. However, they are half-ashamed of their fondness
for such objects, and fail to see that, back of all the
folly and superstition that may find expression in this
way, there is a deeper meaning in these talismans than
we at first perceive. We may be disposed to smile when
we are told that many of the soldiers in the Austro-Prussian
War of 1866 carried amulets of some kind upon their
persons, and that the great Marshal Canrobert trusted
to the protection of an amulet in the Crimean campaign.
Of course the Russian army, during the Russo-Japanese
War, was amply provided with amulets, religious medals
or pictures to which a special virtue had been given by a
priestly blessing.</p>

<p>In all these cases, however, it is not the object itself,
but the idea for which it stands and which it incorporates,
that gives confidence to the wearer, and in this sense the
wearing of a talisman is no more a proof of blind super<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>stition
than is the devotion to a flag, in itself only a few
square feet of silk or bunting, but, nevertheless, the
symbol of the noblest ideas and feelings, of patriotic devotion
to one’s native land and to one’s fellow-countrymen.
The tendency to give a substantial visible form to
an abstract idea is so deeply rooted in humanity that it
must be looked upon as responding to a human necessity.
It is only very rarely that purely intellectual conceptions
can satisfy us; they must be given some external,
palpable and visible form to exert their greater
influences.</p>

<p>Although it may bear a certain superficial likeness to
fetichism, this use of signs and symbols is something
entirely and radically different, for the idea is never lost
sight of, it is only strengthened and vivified by the contemplation
of the symbol. Hence, while we know quite
well that the symbol is nothing in itself, we know just as
well that it has a real power in its relation to the idea
it typifies, and we can no more be indifferent to its injury
or destruction than we could be indifferent to the injury
or destruction of a cherished memento of one whom we
have loved and lost.</p>

<p>What super-subtle sense is it that enables some
women to endow their gems with a certain individuality,
and leads them to feel that these cold, inanimate objects
partake of human emotion? A French writer, Mme.
Catulle Mendès, gives expression to this when she says
that she always wears as many of her rings as possible,
because her gems feel slighted when she leaves them
unworn. She continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have a ruby which grows dull, two turquoises which become pale
as death, aquamarines which look like siren’s eyes filled with tears,
when I forget them too long. How sad I should feel if precious
stones did not love to rest upon me!</p></blockquote>

<p>A very beautiful and curious object was found in
the Australian opal-fields in 1909. This is a reptilean
skeleton resembling a small serpent that has become
opalized by natural processes. Perfect in all its details,
which are rendered more striking by the splendid
play of color, this specimen of Nature’s handiwork possesses
a beauty and an interest exceeding those to be
found in any work of man. As an amulet it certainly
is <i lang="la">sui generis</i>, and in ancient times would have been
valued at an immense sum, for the figure of a serpent
was a favorite symbol of medical science; even to-day
there is little doubt that this strange object will be
eagerly sought for by collectors, and will appeal more
especially to all who are interested in occult science, and
to all who appreciate the poetic and perhaps mystic significance
of form, sign, and symbol.</p>

<p>It is impossible to over-estimate the effect of color
in determining the supposed influence of gems upon the
fortunes or health of the wearers. When we gaze upon
the beautiful play of light emitted by a fine ruby or sapphire,
we are all conscious of the æsthetic effect produced;
but in earlier times, when scientific ideas were not
yet prevalent, many other considerations combined to
give a peculiar significance to these brilliant gems. Rare
and costly as they were, they were supposed to possess
mystic and occult powers and were thought to be the
abode of spirits, sometimes benevolent and sometimes
malevolent, but always endowed with the power to influence
human destinies for weal or woe. Coupled with
this was the instinctive appreciation of the essential
qualities of certain rays of light, and modern science,
far from doing away with these ideas, has rather seemed
to find a good reason for them. We all know the therapeutic
value of the ultra-violet rays, and when the unin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>structed
mind saw therein the embodiment of purity and
chastity, it perhaps realized this health-giving and beneficent
function. In the same way the idea of passion
was associated with the red and radiant ruby, another
concept the relative truth of which has been demonstrated
by spectrum analysis, since the red rays are heat-giving
and vivifying. But this was not the only source
of these primitive ideas in regard to color; the therapeutic
effect was often sought and found in some fancied
analogy between the color of the gem and the character
of the malady or infirmity to be cured. Thus, yellow
stones were supposed to be especially efficacious in cases
of jaundice, an instance of instinctive homœopathy, based
on the dictum <i lang="la">similia similibus curantur</i>. Following out
this train of thought, the red stones were endowed with
the power of checking the flow of blood; especially the
so-called bloodstone was prescribed for this use, and it
was supposed that by its mere touch it could stop the
most violent hemorrhages. Green was regarded as the
color most beneficial for the sight, and to the emerald
and other green stones was ascribed great curative power
in this respect. Here, however, the simple influence of
the color was later combined with its symbolical significance.
In heathen mythology this showed itself in the
ascription of the emerald to Venus, as the exponent of
the reproductive energies of nature, while in the Christian
conception these stones became typical of the resurrection,
of the birth into a new and purer life. Nowhere
can we find a better illustration of the transforming
effect of distinct and diametrically opposite concepts
upon the impressions made by natural objects. The
pure and colorless and yet brilliant stones, such as the
diamond and all other white stones, were naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
brought into connection with the moon, although the
diamond, because of its superior qualities and exceptional
brilliance and value, was frequently looked upon
as the gem of the sun. All gems associated with the moon
partook of its enigmatic character. Illuminating the
witching hour of the night, when malevolent and treacherous
spirits were supposed to hold sway, the moon was
sometimes regarded as baleful, as may be seen in the
idea that associated lunacy with exposure to the bright
rays of the moon; at other times it was supposed to have
the power to conjure these evil influences and to drive
off the powers of darkness.</p>

<p>The symbolical significance of the colors of precious
stones is treated at considerable length by Giacinto
Gimma,<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> who has gathered together a great quantity of
material on the subject.</p>

<p>Yellow worn by a man denoted secrecy, and was appropriate
for the silent lover; worn by a woman it indicated
generosity. Golden yellow was, of course, the
symbol of the sun and of Sunday. The precious stone
was the chrysolite or the yellow jacinth. The animal
connected with the color was the lion, doubtless, from
the association of the zodiacal sign Leo with the midsummer
sun. Of the seven ages of man yellow typified
adolescence. Roman matrons covered their heads with
a yellow veil to show their hope of offspring and happiness.
Because garments of this color were a sign of
grandeur and nobility, a golden vestment is assigned to
the Queen of Heaven as a sign of her pre-eminence, as
we read in Psalm xlv, 9: “Upon thy right hand did stand
the queen in gold of Ophir.” Gimma’s explanation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
this as referring to the Virgin Mary is in accord with
the Catholic exegesis of his time.</p>

<p>White signified for men friendship, religion, integrity;
for women, contemplation, affability, and purity.
It was associated with the moon and with Monday and
was represented by the pearl. The animal having an
affinity with white was quite naturally the ermine. The
mystic number was seven, and white was the color of infancy.
Among the ancients white was a sign of mourning
and sadness, and the Greek matrons attired themselves
in white on the death of their husbands. Gimma
states that in his time, in Rome, widows used to wear
white as mourning for their husbands, while throughout
Italy a white band worn around the head was a sign of
widowhood.</p>

<p>Red garments on a man indicated command, nobility,
lordship, and vengeance; on a woman, pride, obstinacy,
and haughtiness. This was the color of the planet Mars
and of Tuesday; it was represented by the ruby. Why
the lynx should have been selected as the animal for red
is rather difficult to understand, but, as the most vivid
color, the choice of red as a type of full manhood need
not surprise us. Its number was the potent nine, three
multiplied by itself. The ancients covered with a red
cloth the biers of those who had died valiantly in battle,
as Homer<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> shows when he relates that the brothers and
companions of Hector covered the urn containing the
hero’s ashes with soft purple (scarlet) robes. Plutarch
asserts that the Lacedemonians clothed their soldiers in
red to strike terror into the hearts of their enemies and
to manifest a thirst for blood. We might perhaps say
much the same of the English “red-coats” to-day. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Italian code of criminal laws known as the “Digesto
Nuovo” was bound in red, to signify that a bloody death
awaited thieves and murderers.</p>

<p>Blue on a man’s dress indicated wisdom and high and
magnanimous thoughts; on a woman’s dress, jealousy in
love, politeness, and vigilance. Friday and Venus were
represented by blue, and the celestial-hued sapphire was
the stone in which this color appeared in all its beauty.
Blue was a fit symbol of the age of childhood, but it is
less easy to understand the choice of the goat as the
animal associated with the color. The significant number
was six. Natural science, the contemplation of the
heavens and of the heavenly bodies, and the study of
stellar influences were all typified by blue.</p>

<p>Green signified for men joyousness, transitory hope,
and the decline of friendship; for women, unfounded
ambition, childish delight, and change. The early verdure
of spring might be regarded as at once a symbol of
hope and of eventual disappointment, for it must soon
pass away. Mercury, and Wednesday, the day of Mercury,
were both typified by green, the sly fox being
selected as the animal is sympathy with the wily god.
The typical green stone is the emerald, youth is the age
of man represented by the color, and five the magic
number expressing it. In ancient times green was used
in the case of those who died in the flower of youth, an
emerald being sometimes placed on the index-finger of
the corpse, as a sign that the light of hope was spent,
for the lower part of the torches used in religious ceremonies
was marked with green. Fulvius Pellegrinus relates
that, in the tomb of Tullia, the dearly-beloved
daughter of Cicero, there was found an emerald, the most
beautiful that had ever been seen. This passed into the
hands of the Marchesana di Mantova, Isabella Gonzaga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
da Este. In Italy the graves of young virgins and of
children were covered with green branches. When the
Codex Justinianus was rediscovered and added to the
other Pandects, it was bound in green to signify that
these laws were rejuvenated.</p>

<p>Black for men means gravity, good sense, constancy,
and fortitude; for young women, fickleness and foolishness,
but for married women, constant love and perseverance.
The planet Saturn and Saturday are denoted
by black. Strange to say, the diamond, the white gem
<i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, was selected to represent this sombre
hue. Perhaps to offset this the animal chosen was the
hog. As black was a mourning color, we need not be surprised
that it typified decrepitude. The number eight,
the double square, was supposed to have some affinity
with black. Black is a symbol of envy, for the thoughts
which aim at another’s injury cloud the soul and afflict
the body. The book of laws treating of dispositions made
in view of death was bound in black. The sinister significance
of black is well illustrated by what is told of
the ruthless Tartar Tamerlane. When he attacked a
city, he caused a white tent to be pitched for himself on
the first day of the siege, as a sign that mercy would be
shown to the inhabitants if they immediately surrendered;
on the second day a red tent was substituted,
signifying that if the city yielded, all the leaders would
be put to death; on the third day, however, a black
tent was raised, an ominous signal that no mercy
would be shown and that all the inhabitants would be
slaughtered.</p>

<p>Violet for a man denoted sober judgment, industry,
and gravity; for a woman, high thoughts and religious
love. It was the color of the planet Jupiter and of
Thursday. As with blue, the sapphire was conceived to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
present violet most attractively. That the bull should
be selected as the animal represented by this color probably
arose from some mythological connection with Jupiter,
possibly the myth of Europa and the bull. Violet was
the color of old age and was associated with the number
three.</p>

<p>The influence of color upon the nerves has been noted
by some of the leading authorities on hypnotism. For
example, Dr. Paul Ferez, finding that red light is stimulating
and blue-violet calming, suggests that those who
treat patients by means of hypnotism should have two
rooms for their reception. In one of these rooms the
curtains, wall-paper, chair-coverings, etc., would be red,
while in the other they would be of a violet-blue hue.
Those suffering from a lack of will-power or from lassitude
and depression are to be received in the red room,
and those who are a prey to over-excitability are introduced
into the blue room. Moreover, according to Dr.
Ferez, the sedative qualities of the violet-blue can be
utilized in inducing the hypnotic state. For this purpose
he recommends a violet-blue disk, which is to be
rotated rapidly before the eyes of the patient, the movement
serving to attract and hold his gaze better than any
immovable object would do.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Red stones such as rubies, carbuncles, and garnets,
whose color suggested that of blood, were not only believed
to confer invulnerability from wounds, but some
Asiatic tribes have used garnets as bullets, upon the
contrary principle that this blood-colored stone would
inflict a more deadly wound than would a leaden bullet.
Such bullets were used by the rebellious Hanzas, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
1892, during their hostilities with the British troops on
the Kashmir frontier, and many of these precious missiles
were preserved as curiosities.</p>

<p>In his “Colloquy on Pilgrimages,” Erasmus makes
one of the speakers ask, “Dost thou not see how the
artificer Nature delights to represent all things by colors
and forms, but more especially in gems?” He then proceeds
to enumerate the various images of natural objects
in stones. In the ceraunia appeared the thunder-bolt;
in the pyrope, living fire; the chalazia (rock-crystal)
preserved the form and coldness of the hailstone even
if cast into the fire. In the emerald were shown the deep
and translucent waves of the sea; the carcinia imitated
the form of crabs; the echites, of vipers; the hieracites,
of hawks; the geranites, of cranes. The ætites offered
the image of an eagle with a white tail; the taos had the
form of a peacock; the chelonites, of an asp; while the
myrmecites bore within the figure of an ant.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The stones
bearing this latter name were probably specimens of
amber containing ants.</p>

<p>The Greek names of these stones enumerated by
Erasmus signify their real or supposed resemblance to
certain natural objects, or to something characteristic
of such objects. Many of them were fossils, preserving
the form of some living organism; a few were entirely
fabulous; still others owed their names to some legend
or myth illustrating their fancied therapeutic virtues, as
in the case of the ætites (eagle-stone) said to be found
in the eagle’s nest. Evidently this was a quartz pebble.</p>

<p>The oldest magic formulas that have been preserved
for us are those of the Sumerians, the founders of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
ancient civilization of Babylonia. Some of them contain
references to the use of precious stones as amulets, as
appears in the following specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Cords of light-colored wool,</div>
<div class="verse">Offered (?) with a pure hand,</div>
<div class="verse">For jaundice of the eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Bind on the right side (of the patient).</div>
<div class="verse">A lululti ring, with sparkling stones</div>
<div class="verse">Brought from his own land,</div>
<div class="verse">For inflammation of the eye,</div>
<div class="verse">On the little finger</div>
<div class="verse">Of his left (hand), place.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A curious Babylonian mythological text represents
the solar deity Ninib, the son of Bel, as determining the
fate of various stones by pronouncing a blessing or a
curse upon them. For instance, the dolomite was blessed
and declared to be fit material for the statues of kings,
while a substance called the <i>elu</i> stone was cursed, proclaimed
to be unfit for working, and doomed to disintegration.
Alabaster was favored by the god, but chalcedony
aroused his anger and was condemned.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>In these Sumero-Assyrian inscriptions, there is also
mention of two stones, the <i lang="su">aban râme</i> and the <i lang="su">aban la
râme</i>, the “Stone of Love” and the “Stone of Hate” (lit.
“non-love”).<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Evidently these stones were believed to
excite one or other of these contradictory passions in the
hearts of the wearers, and they may be compared with
the stones of memory and forgetfulness in the “Gesta
Romanorum.”</p>

<p>In an ancient Egyptian burial-place at Shêch Abd el-Qurna,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
excavated by Passalaqua, was found the mummy
of a young woman. Not only was it evident from the
rich ornaments adorning the body that she had been of
noble birth, but it was also apparent that she must have
been exceedingly beautiful in form and feature, and must
have died in the flower of her age. The hair was artistically
braided and adorned with twenty bronze hairpins.
About her neck was a remarkably beautiful necklace
composed of four rows of beads with numerous
pendants representing divinities and sacred symbols.
There were also two smaller necklaces with beads of
gold, lapis-lazuli, and carnelian; two large jewelled ear-rings
hung from her ears, and on the index-finger of her
right hand was a ring set with a scarab; a gold belt
garnished with lapis-lazuli and carnelians was bound
about her waist and a gold bracelet adorned with semi-precious
stones encircled her left wrist. In the sarcophagus
was a beautiful mirror of golden-yellow bronze,
and three alabaster vases, one still containing some balm
or perfume, and another some galena (native lead sulphide)
to be used as a cosmetic for the eyes, as well as a
little ebony pencil for its application. All these objects
are now in the Egyptian collection of the Berlin Museum,
and they probably belong to the period of the XVIII
Dynasty, about 1500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The principal necklace was undoubtedly regarded by
the fair Egyptian as an amulet of great power, but it
failed to protect her from an untimely end; perhaps,
however, its virtues may have aided her soul in its passage
through the trials and tests imposed in the underworld.
Of the numerous pendants which lent to the necklace
its peculiar quality as an amulet, three, in carnelian,
figure the god Bes; seven, also in carnelian, the hippo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>potamus-goddess
Toeris, of whom there are besides two
representations in lapis-lazuli; then we have a heart of
lapis-lazuli; a cat of lapis-lazuli; four falcons of carnelian;
one crocodile of carnelian and two of lapis-lazuli;
four fish of carnelian, as well as two others of a blackish-white
and of a green stone, respectively, and two scorpions
of carnelian, and seven flower-forms of the same
stone. The greater part of the beads in this necklace
are of annular form, of gold, electrum, ivory, or lapis-lazuli;
there are a few larger annular or spherical beads
of carnelian, chrysoprase, and malachite, and measuring
up to 3.5 cm. in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>A necklace, from the time of the Old Empire (c. 3500
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and having for its chief adornment a turquoise
pendant rudely fashioned into the form of an ibex, was
found by the German Orient-Gesellschaft at Abusîr el-Meleq
in 1905. This necklace, the parts of which were
found about the neck of a body, presumably that of a
young man, was composed of rounded and annular beads
of carnelian and shell, as well as of flat, perforated fragments
of turquoise and almandine garnet and an approximately
lozenge-shaped bead of amethyst 1.7 cm.
long and 1.4 cm. broad. The chief ornament was the
turquoise ibex 1.7 cm. in length and 0.9 cm. high.<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> This
figure suggests a comparison with the animal and bird
forms fashioned out of turquoise that have been found
in Indian graves in Arizona and New Mexico, and it
probably had the quality of a fetich, or at least of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
talisman, intended to guard the wearer of the necklace
from harm.</p>

<p>That there was in Egypt a strong inclination to use a
certain particular stone for a given amulet, will be noted
in the case of those inscribed with special chapters of
the Book of the Dead. This is also true of amulets of
certain forms. For instance, the head-rest amulet is
usually of hematite as is also the carpenter’s square.
Of the heart amulets, numbering 47 in the rich collections
of the Cairo Museum, nine are of carnelian, four of
hematite, two of lapis-lazuli, and two each of green
porphyry and green jasper, carnelian being thus the most
favored among the more precious materials. Amulets
of animal form are plentifully represented in this collection,
figuring a large variety of members of the animal
kingdom such as the hippopotamus, crocodile, lion, bull,
cow, hare, dog-headed ape, cat, dog (somewhat doubtful),
jackal, hedgehog, frog, hawk, cobra and fishes, to which
list may be added a four-headed ram and a ram-headed
sphinx.<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>One of the special uses of amulets was for seafaring
people, for, in ancient times especially, all who went
down to the sea in ships were greatly in need of protection
from the fury of the elements when they embarked
in their small sailing-vessels. A fragment of a Greek
Lapidary,<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> probably written in the third or fourth century
of our era, gives a list of seven amulets peculiarly
adapted for this purpose. The number might suggest
a connection with the days of the week, and the amulets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
were perhaps regarded as most efficacious when used on
the respective days.</p>

<p>In the first were set a carbuncle and a chalcedony;
this amulet protected sailors from drowning. The second
had for its gem either of two varieties of the adamas,—one,
the Macedonian, being likened to ice (this was probably
rock-crystal), while the other, the Indian, of a silvery
hue, may possibly have been our corundum; however, the
Macedonian stone was regarded as the better. The third
amulet bore the beryl, “transparent, brilliant, and of a
sea-green hue,” evidently the aquamarine beryl; this
banished fear. The fourth had for its gem the <i>druops</i>,
“white in the centre,” probably the variety of agate so
much favored as a protector against the spell of the Evil
Eye. A coral was placed in the fifth amulet, and this
was to be attached to the prow of the ship with strips
of seal-skin; it guarded the vessel from winds and waves
in all waters. For the sixth amulet the <i>ophiokiolus</i> stone
was selected, most probably a kind of banded agate, for
it is said to have been girdled with stripes like the body
of a snake; whoever wore this had no need to fear the
surging ocean. The seventh and last of these nautical
amulets bore a stone called <i>opsianos</i>, apparently a
resinous or bituminous material, possibly a kind of jet;
this came from Phrygia and Galatia, and the amulet
wherein it was set was a great protection for all who
journeyed by sea or by river.</p>

<p>The ancient treatises on the magic art show that the
use of amulets was considered to be indispensable for
those who dared to evoke the dark spirits of the nether-world,
for without the protection afforded by his amulet
the magician ran the risk of being attacked by these
spirits. One of these texts gives directions for preparing
an amulet, or <i>phylacterion</i>, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> “undertaking”;
for this a “sweet-smelling” loadstone should be chosen,
and should be cut heart-shaped and engraved with the
figure of Hecate.<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>A costly Chinese amulet consists of the diamond, the
ruby, and the emerald, to which are added the pearl and
coral; Oriental sapphire and topaz are classed with the
ruby. An amulet containing these five substances is
thought to combine the protecting influences of the different
deities presiding over them, and is supposed to
lengthen the wearer’s life. Sometimes these five princely
gems are wrapped up in a paper bearing the names of
the respective divinities, to which is added the name of
the moon, and those of the twenty-seven constellations,
or houses of the moon. Such an amulet, suspended at
the entrance of a house, is believed to afford protection
to the inmates.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>In the language of the ancient Mexicans blood was
called <i>chalchiuhatl</i>, or “water of precious stones,” as
the quintessence of what were regarded as the most
costly things.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Although such poetic designations are
in modern times mere figures of speech, among primitive
peoples they are more significant, and it is highly
probable that with the Aztecs, as with other peoples, the
wearing of precious stones was believed to enrich the
blood and thus to promote health and vigor, for “the
blood is the life.”</p>

<p>That gems had sex is asserted by the earliest writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
as well as by many of those of a later date. While this
must usually be understood as a poetic way of indicating
a difference in shade, the darker varieties being regarded
as male and the lighter ones as female, Theophrastus,
the earliest Greek writer on precious stones, clearly
shows that this sexual distinction was sometimes seriously
made, for he declares that, wonderful as it might
seem, certain gems were capable of producing offspring.</p>

<p>This strange idea was still prevalent in the sixteenth
century, and ingenious explanations were sometimes
given of the cause of this phenomenon, as appears in
the following account by Rueus of germinating diamonds:<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It has recently been related to me by a lady worthy of credence,
that a noblewoman, descended from the illustrious house of Luxemburg,
had in her possession two diamonds which she had inherited, and
which produced others in such miraculous wise, that whoever examined
them at stated intervals judged that they had engendered progeny like
themselves. The cause of this (if it be permissible to philosophize
regarding such a strange matter) would seem to be that the celestial
energy in the parent stones, qualified by some one as “<i lang="la">vis adamantifica</i>,”
first changes the surrounding air into water, or some similar
substance, and then condenses and hardens this into the diamond gem.</p></blockquote>

<p>The pearl-fishers of Borneo are said to preserve
carefully every ninth pearl they find, and place them
in a bottle with two grains of rice for each pearl, believing,
in spite of all evidence to the contrary, that these
particular pearls have the power to engender and breed
others. Custom and superstition require that each
bottle shall have the finger of a dead man as a stopper.</p>

<p>Talismanic influences are taken into account in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
wearing of jewelry by Orientals, two bracelets being
frequently worn lest one member should become jealous
of the other, thus disturbing the equilibrium of the
whole organism. The piercing of the ears for ear-rings
has been attributed to a desire to chastise the ear for
its indiscretion in hearing secrets not intended to be
heard, while costly and ornamental ear-rings are set in
the ears to console those
parts of our anatomy for
the suffering caused by
the operation of piercing.
In the case of necklaces of
brilliant metal, adorned
with pendants of glittering
stones, the talismanic purpose
is to attract the beholder’s
gaze and thus
ward off the mysterious
and dangerous emanations
set forth by the Evil
Eye; the necklace, or its
ornaments, are supposed
to perform a similar service
to that rendered by
the lightning-rod in diverting
the electric discharge.</p>

<p>At an early date the Christian Church registered its
opposition to the practice of wearing amulets. At the
Council of Laodicea, held in 355 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, it was decreed, in
the thirty-fourth canon, that priests and clerks must be
neither enchanters, mathematicians, nor astrologers, and
that they must not make “what are called amulets,” for
these were fetters of the soul, and all who wore them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
should be cast out of the church.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> This emphatic condemnation
of the prevailing usage was not so much a
protest against superstition <i lang="la">per se</i> as against pagan
superstition, for almost if not all the amulets in use in
the early centuries of our era bore heathen or heretical
symbols or inscriptions. In later times the invincible
tendency to wear objects of this character found expression
in the use of those associated with Christian belief,
such, for instance, as relics of the saints, medallions
blessed by the priest, etc.</p>

<p>The amulets of the Jews differed in many respects
from those used by Christians. The Mosaic prohibition
of representations of human or animal forms imposed
great restrictions upon the employment of engraved
gems, and the Jew was only permitted to wear or carry
those bearing merely characters of mystic or symbolic
significance. In talmudic times amulets were sometimes
hidden in a hollow staff, and they were believed to have
more power when concealed from view in this way.
They were like concealed weapons, and it was said that,
as a father might give such an amulet to a son, so God
had given the Law to Israel for its protection.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>In the Old French didactic poem, the <i lang="fr">Roman de la
Rose</i>, composed in the twelfth century, appear traces of
the belief in the magic properties of precious stones.
Chaucer translated this poem into English in the fourteenth
century and we quote the following lines from
his version. They describe the costume of the symbolical
figure, Riches.</p>

<p>At the trial, in 1232, of Hubert de Burgh, chief justiciar,
one of the charges brought against him was that
he had surreptitiously removed from the English treasury
an exceedingly valuable stone, possessing the virtue
of rendering the wearer invincible in battle, and had
given it to Llewellyn, King of Wales, the enemy of his
own sovereign, Henry III of England (1207-1272).<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
This must have taken place about 1228, when Henry was
engaged in a war with the Welsh.</p>

<p>That precious stones could, under certain circumstances,
lose the powers inherent in them was firmly believed
in medieval times. If handled or even gazed upon
by impure persons and sinners, some of the virtues of
the stones departed from them. Indeed, there were those
who held that precious stones, in common with all created
things, were corrupted by the sin of Adam. Therefore,
in order to restore their pristine virtue it might become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
necessary to sanctify and consecrate them, and a kind of
ritual serving this purpose has been preserved in several
old treatises. The subject is sufficiently curious to warrant
here the repetition of one of these forms. The stones
which required consecration were to be wrapped in a
perfectly clean linen cloth and placed on the altar. Then
three masses were to be said over them, and the priest
who celebrated the third mass, clad in his sacred vestments,
was to pronounce the following benediction:<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Lord be with us. And with thy spirit. Let us pray. Almighty
God and Father, who manifestedst thy virtue to Elias by certain
senseless creatures, who orderedst Moses, Thy servant, that, among
the sacerdotal vestments, he should adorn the Rational of Judgment
with twelve precious stones, and showedst to John, the evangelist, the
famous city of Jerusalem, essentially constituted by the same stones,
and who hadst the power to raise up sons to Abraham from stones,
we humbly beseech Thy majesty since Thou hast elected one of the
stones to be a dwelling-place for the majesty of Thy heart, that Thou
wilt deign to bless and sanctify these stones by the sanctification and
incarnation of Thy name, so that they may be sanctified, blessed,
and consecrated, and may receive from Thee the effect of the virtues
Thou hast granted to them, according to their kinds, and which the
experience of the learned has shown to have been given by Thee; so
that whoever may wear them on him may feel the presence of Thy
power and may be worthy to receive the gift of Thy grace and the
protection of Thy power. Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, in whom
dwells all sanctification, benediction, and consecration; who lives with
Thee and reigns as God for all eternity, Amen. Thanks be to God.</p></blockquote>

<p>Konrad of Megenburg also gives this benediction in
his “Buch der Natur.”</p>

<p>Luther tells the following humorous tale of a Jew
who was a vender of amulets:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is sorcery among the Jews and their sorcerers think: “If
we succeed, it is well for us; if we fail, a Christian is the sufferer;
what care we for that?” ... But Duke Albert of Saxony acted
shrewdly. When a Jew offered him a button, inscribed with curious
characters and signs, and asserted that this button gave protection
from cuts, thrusts, and shots, the Duke answered: “I will test that
upon thyself, O Jew.” Hereupon he led the man to the gate, hung
the button at his neck, drew his own sword, and thrust the fellow
through the body. “The same fate would have happened to me,” said
the Duke, “as has happened to thee.”<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Ruskin, with his keen poetic insight into the working
of natural laws, saw in the formation of crystals the
action of both “force of heart” and “steadiness of purpose.”
He thus found himself, consciously or unconsciously,
in agreement with the old fancies which attributed
a species of personality to precious stones. Just
as the Hindu regarded an imperfectly shaped crystal as
a bringer of ill luck to the owner, so Ruskin sees in such
a crystal the signs of an innate “immorality,” if we may
use this expression. Of a crystal aggregation of this
type he writes as follows:<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Opaque, rough-surfaced, jagged on the edge, distorted in the
spine, it exhibits a quite human image of decrepitude and dishonour;
but the worst of all signs of its decay and helplessness is, that halfway
up, a parasite crystal, smaller, but just as sickly, has rooted itself in
the side of the larger one, eating out a cavity round its root, and then
growing backwards, or downwards, contrary to the direction of the
main crystal. Yet I cannot trace the least difference in purity of
substance between the first most noble stone, and this ignoble and
dissolute one. The impurity of the last is in its will or want of will.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is established a very pretty custom of assigning
to the various masculine and feminine Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
names a particular gem, and such name-gems are often
set together with natal and talismanic gems and with
gems of one’s patron saint. It is considered an exceedingly
good omen when it happens that all three gems are
of the same sort.</p>

<small>On the Talismanic Use of Special Stones</small><a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></h2>


<h3 class="h3l">Agate</h3>

<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE author of “Lithica” celebrates the merits of the
agate in the following lines:<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Adorned with this, thou woman’s heart shall gain,</div>
<div class="verse">And by persuasion thy desire obtain;</div>
<div class="verse">And if of men thou aught demand, shalt come</div>
<div class="verse">With all thy wish fulfilled rejoicing home.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This idea is elaborated by Marbodus, Bishop of
Rennes, in the eleventh century, who declares that agates
make the wearers agreeable and persuasive and also give
them the favor of God.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Still other virtues are recounted
by Camillo Leonardo, who claims that these stones give
victory and strength to their owners and avert tempests
and lightning.<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The agate possessed some wonderful virtues, for its
wearer was guarded from all dangers, was enabled to
vanquish all terrestrial obstacles and was endowed with
a bold heart; this latter prerogative was presumably the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
secret of his success. Some of these wonder-working
agates were black with white veins, while others again
were entirely white.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>The wearing of agate ornaments was even believed to
be a cure for insomnia and was thought to insure pleasant
dreams. In spite of these supposed advantages, Cardano
asserts that while wearing this stone he had many
misfortunes which he could not trace to any fault or
error of his own. He, therefore, abandoned its use;
although he states that it made the wearer more prudent
in his actions.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Indeed, Cardano appears to have tested
the talismanic worth of gems according to a plan of his
own,—namely, by wearing them in turn and noting the
degree of good or ill fortune he experienced. By this
method he apparently arrived at positive results based
on actual experience; but he quite failed to appreciate
the fact that no real connection of any kind existed between
the stones and their supposed effects. In another
treatise this author takes a somewhat more favorable
view of the agate, and proclaims that all varieties render
those who wear them “temperate, continent, and cautious;
therefore they are all useful for acquiring riches.”<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>According to the text accompanying a curious print
published in Vienna in 1709, the attractive qualities of
the so-called coral-agate were to be utilized in an air-ship,
the invention of a Brazilian priest. Over the head
of the aviator, as he sat in the air-ship, there was a network
of iron to which large coral-agates were attached.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
These were expected to help in drawing up the ship,
when, through the heat of the sun’s rays, the stones had
acquired magnetic power. The main lifting force was
provided by powerful magnets enclosed in two metal
spheres; how the magnets themselves were to be raised
is not explained.<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>About the middle of the past century, the demand for
agate amulets was so great in the Soudan that the extensive
agate-cutting establishments at Idar and Oberstein
in Germany were almost exclusively busied with
filling orders for this trade. Brown or black agates
having a white ring in the centre were chiefly used for
the fabrication of these amulets, the white ring being
regarded as a symbol of the eye. Hence the amulets
were supposed to neutralize the power of the Evil Eye,
or else to be emblematic of the watchfulness of a
guardian spirit. The demand for these amulets has
fallen off greatly, but when it was at its height single
firms exported them to the value of 40,000 thalers ($30,000)
annually, the total export amounting to hundreds
of thousands of thalers. Even at present a considerable
trade in these objects is still carried on. That there is
a fashion in amulets is shown by the fact that, while red,
white, and green amulets are in demand on the west coast
of Africa, only white stones are favored for this use in
Northern Africa.</p>

<h3 class="h3l">Alexandrite</h3>

<p>There are a few talismanic stones which have gained
their repute in our time, notably the alexandrite, a
variety of chrysoberyl found in Russia, in the emerald
mines on the Takowaya, in the Ural region. The discovery
of this variety is stated to have been made in 1831
on the day Alexander II (then heir-apparent) reached
his majority, and it was therefore named alexandrite, by
Nordenskjöld, the mineralogist. The stone as found in
gem form rarely weighs over from one to three carats,
and is characterized by a marked pleochroism of a splendid
green changing to a beautiful columbine red. But in
Ceylon much larger gems are found, some few weighing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
60 carats each, although rarely of more than one or two
carats. The color is of a darker and more bottle-like
green, and the change by night renders them darker and
more granitized than the Russian stones, which are extremely
rare. As red and green are the Russian national
colors, the alexandrite has become a great favorite with
the Russians, and is looked upon as a stone of good omen
in that country. Such, however, is its beauty as a gem
that its fame is by no means confined to Russia, and it
is eagerly sought in other lands as well.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Amber</h3>

<p>Amber was one of the first substances used by man
for decoration, and it was also employed at a very early
period for amulets and for medicinal purposes. More
or less shapeless pieces of rough amber, marked with
circular depressions, have been found in Prussia,
Schleswig-Holstein, and Denmark, in deposits of the
Stone Age. These depressions are sometimes regularly
disposed and at other times irregularly, and seem intended
to imitate similar depressions found in large
stones and rocks, often the work of man’s hand, but
occasionally the result of natural causes. In Hoernes’
opinion they marked the resting place of the spirit or
spirits believed to animate the stone, and hence it is
probable that the amber fragments were used as talismans
or amulets.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>For the ancient Greek poets, the grains of amber
were the tears annually shed over the death of their
brother Phaëthon by the Heliades after grief had meta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>morphosed
them into poplars growing on the banks of
the Eridanus (the modern river Po).<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> In a lost tragedy
of Sophocles, he saw the origin of amber in the tears
shed over the death of Meleager by certain Indian birds.
For Nicias it was the “juice” or essence of the brilliant
rays of the setting
sun, congealed in the
sea and then cast
up upon the shore.
A more prosaic explanation
likened amber
to resin, and regarded
it as being
an exudation from
the trunks of certain
trees. Indeed, the
poetic fancy we have
just noted is the same
idea clothed in a metaphorical
or mythological
form. Another
fancy represented
amber to be the solidified
urine of the lynx,
hence one of its
names, <i>lyncurius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

</div>

<p>The brilliant and beautiful yellow of certain ambers
and the fact that this material was very easily worked
served to make its use more general, and it soon became
a favorite object of trade and barter between the peoples
of the Baltic Coast and the more civilized peoples to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
south. Schliemann found considerable amber from the
Baltic in the graves of Mycenæ, and the frequent allusions
to it in the works of Latin authors of the first and
succeeding centuries testify to its popularity in the
Roman world.</p>

<p>Probably the very earliest allusion in literature to
the ornamental use of amber appears in Homer’s Odyssey,<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
where we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent28">Eurymachus</div>
<div class="verse">Received a golden necklace, richly wrought,</div>
<div class="verse">And set with amber beads, that glowed as if</div>
<div class="verse">With sunshine. To Eurydamas there came</div>
<div class="verse">A pair of ear-rings, each a triple gem,</div>
<div class="verse">Daintily fashioned and of exquisite grace.</div>
<div class="verse">Two servants bore them.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Amber ingeniously carved into animal forms has been
discovered in tumuli at Indersoen, Norway.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> These
curious objects were worn as amulets, and the peculiar
forms were supposed to enhance the power of the material,
giving it special virtues and rendering it of greater
value and efficacy.</p>

<p>Pieces of amber with singular natural markings were
greatly esteemed, especially when these markings suggested
the initials of the name of some prominent person.
Thus, we are told that Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia
paid to a dealer a high price for a piece of amber on
which appeared his initials. The same dealer had another
piece on which he read the initials of Charles XII
of Sweden. When he received the news of this king’s
death, he bitterly lamented having lost the opportunity
of selling him amber for a high price. But he was
cleverly consoled by Nathaniel Sendal, the relator of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
story, who easily persuaded the dealer that the markings
could just as well signify the initials of some other name.
Sendal adduces this as a proof that the letters read on
such pieces of amber were as much the product of the
observer’s imagination as of the markings on the material.<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
Those who secured amber so mysteriously marked
by Nature’s hand probably felt that they had obtained a
talisman of great power, especially destined for their
use.</p>

<h3 class="h3l">Amethyst</h3>

<p>While the special and traditional virtue of the amethyst
was the cure of drunkenness, many other qualities
were attributed to this stone in the fifteenth century.
For Leonardo,<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> it had the power to control evil thoughts,
to quicken the intelligence, and to render men shrewd in
business matters. An amethyst worn on the person had
a sobering effect, not only upon those who had partaken
too freely of the cup that intoxicates, but also upon those
over-excited by the love-passion. Lastly, it preserved
soldiers from harm and gave them victory over their
enemies, and was of great assistance to hunters in the
capture of wild animals. The amethyst shared with
many other stones the power to preserve the wearer from
contagion.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>A pretty legend in regard to the amethyst has been
happily treated in French verse. The god Bacchus,
offended at some neglect that he had suffered, was determined
to avenge himself, and declared that the first person
he should meet, when he and his train passed along,
should be devoured by his tigers. Fate willed it that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
luckless mortal was a beautiful and pure maiden named
Amethyst, who was on her way to worship at the shrine
of Diana. As the ferocious beasts sprang toward her,
she sought the protection of the goddess, and was saved
from a worse fate by being turned into a pure white stone.
Recognizing the miracle and repenting of his cruelty,
Bacchus poured the juice of the grape as a libation over
the petrified body of the maiden, thus giving to the stone
the beautiful violet hue that so charms the beholder’s
eye.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>From the various descriptions of this stone given by
ancient writers, it appears that one of the varieties was
probably the purple almandine or Indian garnet, and it
is not improbable that we have here the reason for the
name amethyst and for the supposed virtue of the stone
in preserving from drunkenness. For if water were
poured into a vessel made of a reddish stone, the liquid
would appear like wine, and could nevertheless be drunk
with impunity.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Beryl</h3>

<p>Arnoldus Saxo, writing about 1220, after reciting the
virtues of the beryl as given by Marbodus, after Evax
and Isidorus, reports in addition that the stone gave help
against foes in battle or in litigation; the wearer was
rendered unconquerable and at the same time amiable,
while his intellect was quickened and he was cured of
laziness.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> In the old German translation of Thomas de
Cantimpré’s “De Proprietatibus Rerum,” we read that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the beryl reawakens the love of married people (er hat
auch die art daz er der elaut lieb wiederpringt).<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Bloodstone</h3>


<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="img15"></a>
<img src="images/i_060.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A PRACTICAL TEST OF THE VIRTUES
OF THE BLOODSTONE TO PREVENT
NOSE-BLEED.</p>

<p><small>From the “Hortus Sanitatis” of Johannis de
Cuba [Strassburg, Jean Pryss, ca. 1483]; De
lapidibus, cap. xc. Author’s library.</small></p></div>
</div>

<p>The heliotrope or bloodstone was supposed to impart
a reddish hue to the water in which it was placed, so
that when the rays of
the sun fell upon the
water they gave forth
red reflections. From
this fancy was developed
the strange exaggeration
that this
stone had the power to
turn the sun itself a
blood-red, and to cause
thunder, lightning,
rain, and tempest. The
old treatise of Damigeron
relates this of
the bloodstone, adding
that it announced
future events by producing
rain and by
“audible oracles.”
Probably the conjurors,
before proceeding
to use the
stone for their incantations,
watched the heavens and waited until they noticed
the signs of an approaching storm. They then interpreted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the sounds of the wind and thunder in various ways, so as
to give apt answers to the questions addressed to them
touching future events. It is well known that the sighing
of the wind, and, indeed, all those natural sounds which
constitute the grand symphony of Nature, were interpreted
by prophets and seers into articulate speech. Damigeron
also declares that the bloodstone preserved the faculties
and bodily health of the wearer, brought him consideration
and respect, and guarded him from deception.<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>In the Leyden papyrus the bloodstone is praised as an
amulet in the following extravagant terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The world has no greater thing; if any one have this with him
he will be given whatever he asks for; it also assuages the wrath of
kings and despots, and whatever the wearer says will be believed.
Whoever bears this stone, which is a gem, and pronounces the name
engraved upon it, will find all doors open, while bonds and stone walls
will be rent asunder.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p></blockquote>


<h3 class="h3l">Carbuncle</h3>

<p>The carbuncle was recommended as a heart stimulant;
indeed, so powerful was its action, that the wearers
were rendered angry and passionate and were even
warned to be on their guard against attacks of apoplexy.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
The blood-red hue of the stone also suggested
its use as a symbol of the divine sacrifice of Christ on
the cross. However, not only in Christianity was this
stone used to illustrate religious conceptions, for the
Koran affirms that the Fourth Heaven is composed of car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>buncle.
In mythical fancies too this stone played its
part, for dragon’s eyes were said to be carbuncles.</p>

<p>Rumphius<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> states that in 1687 he was told by a chirurgeon
that the latter had seen in the possession of one
of the rulers in the island of Amboin a carbuncle said to
have been brought by a serpent. The story ran that this
ruler, when a child, had been placed by his mother in a
hammock attached to two branches of a tree. While
there a serpent crept up to him and dropped a stone
upon his body. In gratitude for this gift the parents of
the child fed and cared for the serpent. The stone is
described as having been of a warm yellow hue, verging
on red; it shone so brightly at night that a room could
be illuminated by it. It eventually passed into the possession
of a King of Siam.</p>

<p>Throughout all the East people are afraid of the
envious. They believe that if you envy a person for his
health or his wealth or any good thing he may have, he
will lose it in a short time, and it is the devil who incites

<p>The popularity of the carnelian as a talismanic stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
among Mohammedan peoples is said to be due to the fact
that the Prophet himself wore, on the little finger of his
right hand, a silver ring set with a carnelian engraved
for use as a seal. One of the most famous of the imâms,
Jafar, lent the weight of his authority to the belief in the
virtue of the carnelian, for he declared that all the desires
of any man who wore this stone would be gratified.
Hence in Persia the name of one of the twelve imâms,
comprising Ali and his successors, is frequently engraved
on this stone.<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<div class="caption"> CARNELIAN SEAL, WORN BY NAPOLEON I, NAPOLEON III,
 AND THE PRINCE IMPERIAL.</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><small>This most interesting seal is described by the Rev. C. W. King, the writer on Antique
Gems. It is carnelian, octagonal-shaped, and upon it is engraved the legend: “The slave
Abraham relying upon the Merciful (God).” Napoleon III wore it on his watch-chain.
He said about it: “The First Consul picked it up with his own hands during the campaign
in Egypt and always carried it about him, as his nephew did later.” The Prince Imperial
received it with the following message: “As regards my son, I desire that he will keep, as a
talisman, the Seal which I used to wear attached to my watch.” He carried the seal upon
a string fastened about his neck in obedience to the injunction of his father. At the time
of his lamentable death it must have been carried off in South Africa by the Zulus, when
they stripped his body, and it has never been recovered.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An Armenian writer of the seventeenth century reports
that in India the <i>lâl</i> or balas-ruby, if powdered and
taken in a potion was believed to banish all dark forebodings
and to excite joyous emotions. To the carnelian was
attributed a virtue somewhat analogous to that ascribed
to the turquoise, as anyone wearing a carnelian was proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
against injury from falling houses or walls; the writer
emphasizes this by stating that “no man who wore a
carnelian was ever found in a collapsed house or beneath
a fallen wall.”<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<h3 class="h3l">Chalcedony</h3>

<p>An ingenious though far-fetched explanation of the
power attributed to chalcedony of driving away phantoms
and visions of the night is supplied by Gonelli,
writing in 1702. For him the source of this asserted
power was to be found in what has been erroneously
termed the alkaline quality of the stone. This dissipated
the evil humors of the eye, thus removing the diseased
condition of that organ which caused the apparitions to
be seen.<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> However absurd this explanation may be, it
nevertheless shows that the author put little faith in visible
ghosts, and rightly enough recognized the purely
subjective character of such phenomena.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Chrysoberyl</h3>

<p>The cat’s-eye variety of chrysoberyl, or precious
cat’s-eye, is used by the natives of Ceylon as a charm
against evil spirits. As a proof of the high value set
upon the gem in India, De Boot states that a cat’s-eye
estimated as worth ninety gold pieces in Lusitania was
sold for six hundred in India.<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Some of the finest specimens
come from Ceylon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Chrysolite</h3>

<p>The “Serpent Isle,” in the Red Sea, was stated by
Agatharcides to be the source whence came the topaz
(chrysolite); here, by the mandate of the Egyptian kings,
the inhabitants collected specimens of this stone and
delivered them to the gem-cutters for polishing.<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> These
simple details are elaborated by Diodorus Siculus into
the legend that the island was guarded by jealous
watchers who had orders to put to death any unauthorized
persons who approached it. Even those who had
the right to seek the gem could not see the chrysolite in
daytime; only after nightfall was it revealed by its radiance;
the seekers then marked well the spot and were
able to find the stone on the following day.<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>From this Egyptian source, and possibly from others
exploited by the Egyptians, have come the finest chrysolites
(peridots, or olivines), the most magnificent examples
of this gem. These found their way into the
cathedral treasures of Europe, evidently by loot or trade
at the period of the Crusades, and are generally called
emeralds. Those most notable are in the Treasury of the
Three Magi, in the great “Dom,” or Cathedral at
Cologne. Some of these gems are nearly two inches long.</p>

<p>In our own land beautiful specimens can be seen in
the Morgan collection at the American Museum of
Natural History and in the Higinbotham Hall in the
Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>Pliny quotes from Juba the tradition that the topaz
(chrysolite) derived its name from the Island of To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>pazos,
in the Red Sea, the first specimen having been
brought thence by the procurator Philemon, to Berenice,
mother of Ptolemy II, Philadelphus. This monarch is
said to have had a statue of his wife Arsinoë made from
the stone.<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> If there be any foundation for this latter
statement, the precious gift sent by Philemon must have
been a mass of fluorspar, or some similar material.
More than three hundred years after Pliny’s time, Epiphanius,
evidently repeating another version of this tradition,
states that the “topaz” was set in the diadem of
the “Theban queen.”</p>

<p>Chrysolite (olivine, peridot), to exert its full power,
required to be set in gold; worn in this way it dispelled
the vague terrors of the night. If, however, it were to be
used as a protection from the wiles of evil spirits, the
stone had to be pierced and strung on the hair of an ass
and then attached to the left arm.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The belief in the
virtue of the chrysolite to dissolve enchantments and to
put evil spirits to flight was probably due to the association
of the stone with the sun, before whose life-giving
rays darkness and all the powers of darkness were driven
away.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Chrysoprase</h3>

<p>Wonderful things are told of the virtue of the chrysoprase,
for Volmar states that, if a thief sentenced to
be hanged or beheaded should place this stone in his
mouth, he would immediately escape from his executioners.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
Although we are not informed in what way
this fortunate result was attained, it seems likely that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
stone was believed to make the thief invisible, and thus
possessed a virtue often attributed to the opal.</p>

<p>A strange story regarding a magic stone reputed to
have been worn by Alexander the Great is related by
Albertus Magnus. According to this recital, Alexander,
in his battles, wore a “prase” in his girdle. On his return
from his Indian campaign, wishing one day to bathe
in the Euphrates, he laid aside his girdle, and a serpent
bit off the stone and then dropped it into the river.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
Even Albertus, who is far from critical, admits that the
story seems like a fable, and it probably belongs to a
comparatively late period. As the term “prase” is used
very loosely by early writers, this “victory stone” may
have been an emerald or possibly jade.</p>

<h3 class="h3l">Coral</h3>

<p>The appreciation of coral as an ornament, or for
amulets, seems to presuppose a certain development of
civilization, for savage tribes greatly prefer glass ornaments.
Many attempts have been made to introduce
coral beads instead of glass beads among such tribes,
but with no success, as the cheaper, but brighter, glass
always commands a higher price.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>To still tempests and traverse broad rivers in safety
was the privilege of one who bore either red or white
coral with him. That this also stanched the flow of blood
from a wound, cured madness, and gave wisdom, was
said to have been experimentally proved.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Coral, which, for twenty centuries or more was classed
among the precious stones, to retain its power as an
amulet, must not have been worked, and in Italy only
such pieces are valued for this purpose as have been
freshly gathered from the sea or have been cast up by
the sea on the shore. To exercise all its power against
spells, or enchantments, coral must be worn where its
brilliant color makes it conspicuous; if, however, it
should by accident be broken, the separate pieces have no
virtue, and the magic power ceases, as though the spirit
dwelling in the coral had fled from its abode. The
peasant women are careful to guard the corals they wear
for a special purpose from the eyes of their husbands,
for the substance is believed to grow pale at certain
seasons, regaining its pristine hue after a short interval
of time. Indeed, the women believe that the coral shares
their indisposition with them. All this serves to show
that a kind of vital force is believed to animate the material,
gaining or losing in vigor according to certain
conditions, and finally disappearing when the form is
broken. These beliefs are all clearly traceable to the
animistic ideas of primitive man.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Diamond</h3>

<p>The diamond is to the pearl as the sun is to the moon,
and we might well call one the “king-gem” and the
other the “queen-gem.” The diamond, like a knight
of old,—brilliant and resistant, is the emblem of fearlessness
and invincibility; the pearl, like a lady of old,—pure
and fair to look upon, is the emblem of modesty
and purity. Therefore it does not seem unfitting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the diamond should be presented as a token to the pearl,
and that pearls should go with the diamond. The virtues
ascribed to this stone are almost all directly traceable
either to its unconquerable hardness or to its transparency
and purity. It was therefore thought to bring
victory to the wearer, by endowing him with superior
strength, fortitude, and courage. Marbodus<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> tells us
it was a magic stone of great power and served to drive
away nocturnal spectres; for this purpose it should be
set in gold and worn on the left arm. For St. Hildegard
the sovereign virtue of the diamond was recognized by
the devil, who was a great enemy of this stone because it
resisted his power by day and by night.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Rueus<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> calls
it “a gem of reconciliation,” as it enhanced the love of a
husband for his wife.</p>

<p>Cardano<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> takes a more pessimistic view of the qualities
of the diamond. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is believed to make the wearer unhappy; its effects therefore
are the same upon the mind as that of the sun upon the eye, for the
latter rather dims than strengthens the sight. It indeed renders fearless,
but there is nothing that contributes more to our safety than
prudence and fear; therefore it is better to fear.</p></blockquote>

<p>The diamond was often associated with the lightning
and was sometimes believed to owe its origin to the
thunderbolt, but we do not recall having seen elsewhere
the statement made in an anonymous Italian manuscript
of the fourteenth century. Here it is expressly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
asserted that the diamond is sometimes consumed or
melted when it thunders.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Certainly, that the same
force that was supposed to have formed the stone should
be able to dissolve it, is not an illogical idea. That the
diamond can be entirely consumed at a high temperature
was a fact not known in Europe in the fourteenth century,
and therefore the belief in the destructive effect
of the electric current must have arisen from superstitious
or poetic fancies, and not from any vague conception
of the true nature of the diamond.</p>

<p>In the Talmud we read of a gem, supposed to have
been the diamond, which was worn by the high priest.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
This stone served to show the guilt or innocence of one
accused of any crime; if the accused were guilty, the stone
would grow dim, but if he were innocent, it would shine
more brilliantly than ever. This quality is also alluded
to by Sir John Mandeville, who wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It happens often that the good diamond loses its virtue by sin and
for incontinence of him who bears it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Hindus classed diamonds according to the four
castes. The Brahmin diamond gave power, friends,
riches and good luck; the Kshatriya diamond prevented
the approach of old age; the Vaisya stone brought success,
and the Sudra, all manner of good fortune. On the
other hand, in the treatise on gems by Buddhabhatta<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A diamond, a part of which is the color of blood or spotted with
red, would quickly bring death to the wearer, even if he were the
Master of Death.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>The Arabians and Persians, as well as the modern
Egyptians, agree in attributing to the diamond a wonderful
power to bring good fortune, and Rabbi Benoni, a
mystic of the fourteenth century, treating of its magic
virtues, asserts that it produces somnambulism, and, as a
talisman, so powerfully attracts the planetary influences
that it renders the wearer invincible; it was also said to
provoke a state of spiritual ecstasy. An alchemist of the
same century, Pierre de Boniface, asserted that the diamond
made the wearer invisible.</p>

<p>A curious fancy, prevalent in regard to many stones,
attributed sex to the diamond, and it is therefore not surprising
that these stones were also supposed to possess
reproductive powers. In this connection Sir John Mandeville
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They grow together, male and female, and are nourished by the
dew of heaven; and they engender commonly, and bring forth small
children that multiply and grow all the year. I have oftentimes tried
the experiment that if a man keep them with a little of the rock, and
water them with May dew often, they shall grow every year and the
small will grow great.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following lines from a translation of the celebrated
Orphic poem, written in the second century, show
the high esteem in which the adamas was held at that
time:</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Evil Eye shall have no power to harm</div>
<div class="verse">Him that shall wear the diamond as a charm,</div>
<div class="verse">No monarch shall attempt to thwart his will,</div>
<div class="verse">And e’en the gods his wishes shall fulfil.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This probably refers either to colorless corundum,
the so-called “white sapphire,” or to quartz. The writer
is disinclined to believe that the ancients knew the diamond.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>The ancient Hindu gem-treatise of Buddhabhatta
asserts that the diamond of the Brahmin should have the
whiteness of a shell or of rock-crystal; that of the Kshatriya,
the brown color of the eye of a hare; that of the
Vaisya, the lovely shade of a petal of the <i lang="sa">kadali</i> flower;
that of the Sudra, the sheen of a polished blade. To
kings alone the sages assigned two classes of colored
diamonds,—namely, those red as coral and those yellow
as saffron. These were exclusively royal gems, but diamonds
of all other shades could be set in royal jewels.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>A typical diamond is thus described in a Hindu gem-treatise:<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A six-pointed diamond, pure, without stain, with pronounced and
sharp edges, of a beautiful shade, light, with well-formed facets,
without defects, illuminating space with its fire and with the reflection
of the rainbow, a diamond of this kind is not easy to find in the
earth.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to a wide-spread superstition, the talismanic
power of a diamond was lost if the stone were
acquired by purchase; only when received as a gift could
its virtues be depended on.<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> The same belief is noted
regarding the turquoise. The spirit dwelling in the stone
was thought to take offence at the idea of being bought
and sold, and was supposed to depart from the stone,
leaving it nothing more than a bit of senseless matter.
If, however, the diamond (or turquoise) were offered as
a pledge of love or friendship, the spirit was quite willing
to transfer its good offices from one owner to another.</p>

<p>The Talmud shows us that the Jewish Rabbis some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>times
endeavored to enliven their exhaustive discussions
of ritual and legal questions by telling “good stories” to
each other. One of these may be given as illustrating at
once the wild improbability of some of these recitals and
the belief in the wonderful magic virtues of the diamond:<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>R. Jehudah of Mesopatamia used to tell: Once while on board of
a ship, I saw a diamond that was encircled by a snake, and a diver went
to catch it. The snake then opened its mouth, threatening to swallow
the ship. Then a raven came, bit off its head, and all water around
turned into blood. Then another snake came, took the diamond, put it
in the carcass, and it became alive; and again it opened its mouth, in
order to swallow the ship. Another bird then came, bit off its head,
took the diamond and threw it on the ship. We had with us salted
birds, and we wanted to try whether the diamond would bring them to
life, so we placed the gem on them, and they became animated and
flew away with the gem.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is said that the first large diamonds discovered by
Europeans in South Africa were found in the leather
bag of a sorcerer. Although large stones or fragments
of rock are usually the objects of adoration as fetiches
in Africa, any small stone that is wrapped in colored
rags and worn on the neck may be regarded in the same
way.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Several competent authorities state that these
diamonds were the playthings of some Boer children.</p>

<p>Al Kazwini relates as follows the marvellous tale of
the Valley of Diamonds:<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> says that no one except Alexander ever reached the
place where the diamond is produced. This is a valley, connected with
the land Hind. The glance cannot penetrate to its greatest depths and
serpents are found there, the like of which no man hath seen, and upon
which no man can gaze without dying. However, this power endures
only as long as the serpents live, for when they die the power leaves
them. In this place summer reigns for six months and winter for the
same length of time. Now, Alexander ordered that an iron mirror
should be brought and placed at the spot where the serpents dwelt.
When the serpents approached, their glance fell upon their own image
in the mirror, and this caused their death. Hereupon, Alexander wished
to bring out the diamonds from the valley, but no one was willing to
undertake the descent. Alexander therefore sought counsel of the wise
men, and they told him to throw down a piece of flesh into the valley.
This he did, the diamonds became attached to the flesh, and the birds
of the air seized the flesh and bore it up out of the valley. Then
Alexander ordered his people to pursue the birds and to pick up what
fell from the flesh.”</p>

<p>“Another writer states that the mines are in the mountains of
Serendib (Ceylon) in a very deep gorge, in which are deadly serpents.
When people wish to take out the diamonds they throw down pieces of
flesh, which are seized by vultures and brought up to the brink of the
gorge. There such of the diamonds as cling to the flesh are secured;
these are of the size of a lentil or a pea. The largest pieces found
attain the size of a half-bean.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In his version of the tale, one form of which appears
in the seventh voyage of Sindbad the Sailor, Teifashi
states that the finest corundum gems were washed down
the streams that flowed from Adam’s Peak, on the island
of Ceylon; in time of drought, however, this source of
supply ceased. Now it happened that many eagles built
their nests on the top of this mountain, and the gem-seekers
used to place large pieces of flesh at the foot of
the mountain. The eagles pounced upon these and bore
them away to their nests, but were obliged to alight from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
time to time in order to rest, and while the pieces of
flesh lay on the rock, some of the corundums became
lightly attached to this, so that when the eagles resumed
their flight the stones dropped off and rolled down the
mountain side.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>These oft-repeated tales are explained by Dr. Valentine
Ball as originating in the Hindu custom of sacrificing
cattle when new mines were opened, and leaving
on the spot a certain part of the meat as an offering to
the guardian deities. As these pieces of meat were soon
carried away by birds of prey, the legend arose that the
diamonds were obtained in this way. This custom still
prevailed in some parts of India when Dr. Ball wrote.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>The effect exercised by Hindu superstition on even
the most enlightened Europeans of our day may be recognized
in the fact that the gifted prima donna, Mme.
Maeterlinck, the wife of the foremost living European
poet, has confessed that she wears a diamond suspended
on her forehead because her husband believes that this
brings good fortune to the wearer. This forehead-jewel
is characteristically Hindu and enjoys in India the reputation
of being especially auspicious.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Emerald</h3>

<p>The emerald was believed to foreshow future events,<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
but we do not learn whether visions were actually seen
in the stone, as they were in spheres of rock-crystal or
beryl, or whether the emerald endowed the wearer with
a supernatural fore-knowledge of what was to come. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
a revealer of truth, this stone was an enemy of all enchantments
and conjurations; hence it was greatly
favored by magicians, who found all their arts of no
avail if an emerald were in their vicinity when they
began to weave their spells.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>To this supernatural power inherent in the stone,
enabling it to quicken the prophetic faculty, may be
added many other virtues. If any one wished to
strengthen his memory or to become an eloquent speaker,
he was sure to attain his end by securing possession of
a fine emerald.<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> And not only the ambitious, but also
those whose hearts had been smitten by the shafts from
Cupid’s bow found in this stone an invaluable auxiliary,
for it revealed the truth or falsity of lover’s oaths.
Strange to say, however, the emerald, although commonly
assigned to Venus, was often regarded as an enemy of
sexual passion. So sensitive was the stone believed to
be in this respect that Albertus Magnus relates of King
Bela of Hungary, who possessed an exceptionally valuable
emerald set in a ring, that, when he embraced his
wife while wearing this ring on his finger, the stone
broke into three parts.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>In Rabbinical legend it is related that four precious
stones were given by God to King Solomon; one of these
was the emerald. The possession of the four stones is
said to have endowed the wise king with power over all
creation.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> As these four stones probably typified the
four cardinal points, and were very likely of red, blue,
yellow, and green color respectively, we might conjecture
that the other three stones were the carbuncle, the lapis-lazuli,
and the topaz.</p>

<p>After stating that the emerald sharpens the wits and
quickens the intelligence, Cardano declares that it
therefore made people more honest, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> “dishonesty is
nothing but ignorance, stupidity, and ill-nature.” The
same writer adds that the stone was believed to make
men economical and hence to make them rich, but of this
he was very sceptical, since the experience of others as
well as his own showed that the emerald possessed very
little power in this direction.<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>A talismanic emerald, once the property of the Mogul
emperors of Delhi, has recently been shown in Europe.
The stone is of a rich deep green, and weighs 78 carats.
Around the edge in Persian characters runs the inscription:
“He who possesses this charm shall enjoy the
special protection of God.”</p>

<p>Emerald sharpened the wits, conferred riches and the
power to predict future events. To evolve this latter
virtue it must be put under the tongue. It also strengthened
the memory. The light-colored stones were esteemed
the best and legend told that they were brought
from the “nests of griffons.”<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Gypsum</h3>

<p>Gypsum when fibrous—the fibres being long and
straight—is known as “satin spar.” This material is
frequently cut rounded, or <i lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, across the fibres;
sometimes it is cut in the form of beads, or of pear-shaped
drops, which are mounted in ear-rings, scarf-pins, or necklaces.
The material is frequently found in Russia,
England, and elsewhere, and is cut in England or Russia.
Some of the cut stones are mounted in brass, or gilded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
brass, and sold as luck stones at Niagara, the claim being
made that the “satin spar” was taken from beneath
the Falls at great peril, as occasionally small deposits of
this kind of gypsum are found under the Falls.</p>

<p>From time to time small consignments of this material
have been sent to Japan, as the Japanese value it possibly
on account of its purity, or owing to the fact that it has
the effect of the cat’s-eye. It is quite cheap, and at the
same time very soft, so that it can be scratched with the
finger-nail. That found in Russia is of a golden-yellow or
salmon color, and is worked into various ornaments, the
one popular form being egg-shaped, and, because of their
form, such objects are frequently given as Easter gifts.
The same material is also known in Egypt, and is cut in
the same egg form, the ornaments being called “Pharaoh’s
eggs,” although just which Pharaoh this refers
to is not stated. They are also believed to possess qualities
of protection and to bring good fortune.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Hematite</h3>

<p>The virtues of the hematite were praised in an ancient
gem-treatise written by Azchalias of Babylon for Mithridates
the Great, King of Pontus (d. 63 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), a sovereign
who was passionately fond of precious stones, and possessed
a splendid collection of them, both engraved and
unengraved. Azchalias, as cited by Pliny<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> taught that
human destinies were influenced by the virtues inherent
in precious stones, and asserted that the hematite, when
used as a talisman, procured for the wearer a favorable
hearing of petitions addressed to kings and a fortunate
issue of lawsuits and judgments. It is a red oxide of
iron, which when abraded shows a red streak; whence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
name hematite, from the Greek <i lang="el">haima</i>, “blood.” As an
iron ore and hence associated with Mars, the god of war,
this substance was also considered to be an invaluable
help to the warrior on the field of battle if he rubbed his
body with it. Probably, like the loadstone, it was believed
to confer invulnerability.</p>

<p>The high degree of skill possessed by the Pueblo
workers is strikingly shown in a finely inlaid hematite
cylinder found in Pueblo Bonito. The inlays are of turquoise
and are designed to make the cylinder a conventional
representation of a bird. The wings are indicated
by turquoise inlays of pyramidal outline, curved so as to
follow the curvature of the cylinder, the head being
figured by a conical piece of turquoise attached to one
end. This conical termination bore a small bird-figure
carved in relief.<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> When we consider the difficulties the
Indian workers had to overcome in the execution of this
artistic task with the tools at their command, we can well
realize that this object, probably an amulet, must have
been considered very valuable, and was most likely the
property of some one of high rank in the tribe or community.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Jacinth</h3>

<p>The jacinth was more especially recommended as an
amulet for travellers, because of its reputed value as a
protection against the plague and against wounds and
injuries, the two classes of perils most feared by those
who undertook long journeys. Moreover, this stone assured
the wearer a cordial reception at any hostelry he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
visited.<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> It was said to lose its brilliancy and grow pale
and dull if the wearer or any one in his immediate neighborhood
became ill of the plague. In addition to these
qualities the jacinth augmented the riches of the owner,
and endowed him with prudence in the conduct of his
affairs.<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>St. Hildegard, the Abbess of Bingen (d. 1179), gives
the following details as to the proper use of the <i>jachant</i>
(jacinth):<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>If any one is bewitched by phantoms or by magical spells, so that
he has lost his wits, take a hot loaf of pure wheaten bread and cut the
upper crust in the form of a cross,—not, however, cutting it quite
through,—and then pass the stone along the cutting, reciting these
words: “May God, who cast away all precious stones from the devil
... cast away from thee, N., all phantoms and all magic spells,
and free thee from the pain of this madness.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The patient is then to eat of the bread; if, however,
his stomach should be too feeble, unleavened bread may
be used. All other solid food given to the sick person
should be treated in the same manner. We are also told
that if any one has a pain in his heart, the pain will be
relieved provided the sign of the cross be made over the
heart while the above mentioned words are recited.</p>

<p>The wearer of a jacinth was believed to be proof
against the lightning, and it was even asserted that wax
that had been impressed by an image graven on this stone
averted the lightning from one who bore the seal. That
the stone really possessed this power was a matter of
common report, it being confidently declared that in re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>gions
where many were struck by lightning, none who
wore a jacinth were ever harmed. By a like miracle it
preserved the wearer from all danger of pestilence even
though he lived in an air charged with the disease. A
third virtue was to induce sleep. Of this, Cardano states
that he was in the habit of wearing rather a large jacinth,
and had found that the stone “seemed to dispose somewhat
to sleep, but not much.” He adds, in explanation
of its slight efficacy, that his stone was not bright red,
nor of the best sort, but of a golden hue, differing much
from the best.<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Jade</h3>

<p>The name jade includes two distinct minerals, nephrite
and jadeite. The former is a silicate of magnesia,
of exceedingly tough structure, and ranks 6.5 in the scale
of hardness, while jadeite, a silicate of alumina, is more
crystalline and not as tough as nephrite and has a hardness
of 7. A variety having a rich emerald-green hue is
called by the Chinese <i lang="zh">fei ts’ui</i>, “Kingfisher plumes”; it
is also denominated Imperial jade.</p>

<p>The original form of the Chinese character <i>pao</i>, signifying
“precious,” consists of the outline of a house, within
which are the symbols of jade beads, shell, and an earthen
jar. This shows that at the very early time when these
characters were first used, the Chinese already collected
jade and employed it for personal adornment.<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The
oldest form of the ideograph for “king”,
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="3 “beads” on a vertical string" />, appears to
be the symbol for a string of jade beads, which are even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
now used in China as insignia for high rank and authority.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Jade amulets of many different forms are popular
with the Chinese. One representing two men is called
“Two Brothers of Heavenly Love,” and is often given to
friends. A phœnix of jade is a favorite ornament for
young girls and is bestowed upon them when they come
of age. To a newly-wedded pair is given the figure of a
man riding on a unicorn and holding castanets in his
hand; this signifies that an heir will be born in due time.</p>

<p>Such is the fondness of the Chinese for jade that those
who can afford the luxury of its possession are wont to
carry with them small pieces, so that they may have them
always at hand; for they believe that, when handled,
something of the secret virtue of the substance is
absorbed into the body. When struck, jade is thought to
emit a peculiarly melodious sound, which for the Chinese
poet resembles the voice of the loved one; indeed, jade is
termed the concentrated essence of love.</p>

<p>Fashioned into the form of a butterfly, a piece of jade
acquires a special romantic significance in China, because
of a Chinese legend which relates that a youth in his
eager pursuit of a many-hued butterfly made his way into
the garden of a rich mandarin. Instead of being punished
for his trespass, the youth’s unceremonious visit led
to his marriage with the mandarin’s daughter. Hence the
figure of a butterfly is a symbol of successful love, and
Chinese bridegrooms are wont to present jade butterflies
to their fiancées.</p>

<p>A Chinese jade ornament constituting a child’s amulet
assumes a form approximating to that of a padlock.
When this is attached to a child’s neck, it is supposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
bind the little one to life and protect it from all danger
in infantile diseases. A jade object of a different kind is
sometimes used at nuptial feasts in China. This is a cup
having the form of a cock, and both bride and groom
drink from it. The form of this vessel is accounted for
by a legend to the effect that when a beautiful white cock
saw its young mistress, who had often petted it, throw
herself into a well in a transport of despair at the loss of
her lover, the faithful fowl sought and found death in
the same way, so as not to be separated from its mistress.</p>

<p>Among the splendid Chinese jade carvings of the
Woodward Collection is a curious symbolic ornament
carved out of the rare <i lang="zh">fei-ts’ui yü</i>, or “kingfisher-green
jade,” a rich emerald green jadeite with translucent
green shading. This ornament, executed in the beginning
of the eighteenth century and believed to be a
product of the Imperial Jade Works in Peking, figures
the natural form of a so-called “hand-of-Buddha” citron,
the finger-like protuberances of the fruit suggesting this
strangely fanciful name. The Chinese regard this as a
most felicitous emblem, denoting at once a long life and
abundance of riches for its enjoyment. In the present
carving the figure of a bat clinging to the foliage enveloping
the fruit constitutes an added omen of good fortune,
the Chinese character <i>fu</i> signifying at once “bat” and
“happiness,” another proof of what we are prone to call
Chinese queerness, for with the superstitious of our race
the bat is always looked upon as especially ill-omened.<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that many analogies have been
found between the customs, usages, and products of the
more civilized aborigines of the New World and those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the ancient Egyptians. Another instance is offered by
the custom of placing a piece of <i>chalchihuitl</i> (jade?) or
of some other green stone in the mouth of a noble, after
his death, and calling this his heart. Among the lower
classes a <i>texaxoctli</i>, a stone of small value, was used for
the same purpose. We shall see that, in the Egyptian
“Book of the Dead,” directions are given for putting a
semi-precious stone on or in a mummy, as a symbol, and
designating this the heart of the deceased person. For
the use of a green stone for this purpose by the ancient
Mexicans, Mrs. Zelia Nuttall finds a reason in the two
meanings of the Nahuatl word <i>xoxouhqui-yollotl</i>, which
is used to signify a “free man,” the literal meaning
being a “fresh or green heart.” Hence, the stone was a
symbol of the rank of the deceased as well as of his
heart.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> The fact that jade celts have been found cut
into several pieces is taken to indicate the high value
placed upon this material; for it has been conjectured by
Dr. Earle Flint, that a living chief would cut a piece
from the jade he wore as a sign of his rank, in order to
provide a suitable ornament or amulet for a dead kinsman.</p>

<p>To certain of the Chinese “tomb-jades”—that is,
jade amulets deposited with the dead—has been given the
name <i lang="zh">han-yü</i>, or “mouth-jade,” because these amulets,
supposed to afford protection to the dead, were placed in
their mouths. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York contains a fine collection of 279 specimens of jade
from Chinese tombs, found within the past five or six
years, and presented to the museum by Mr. Samuel F.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Peters. In color these jades are not especially attractive,
for the material has acquired a brownish stain, due to the
products of decomposition of the body, and also to the
absorption of some of the chemical constituents of the
other objects in the tomb, during the long period of time,
in many cases a thousand years or more, since the bodies
were consigned to their final resting place.</p>

<p>So multifarious are the uses to which jade is put by
the Chinese, and so great is their admiration of its
qualities, that they regard it as the musical gem <i lang="fr">par
excellence</i>. A series of oblong pieces of jade, of the same
length and width, usually about 1.8 feet long and 1.35
feet wide, and numbering from 12 to 24, constitute a
chime, the difference in the notes emitted by the material
when sharply struck depending upon the varying thickness
of the separate pieces. What is designated the
“stone chime” used in court and religious ceremonials, is
composed of 16 undecorated stones, while a series known
as the singers’ chime consists of from 12 to 24 pieces
carved into fantastic shapes. This use of jade for the
production of musical sounds dates far back in the
Chinese annals. We are told that when Confucius was
much troubled at the ill-success of his efforts to reform
the Chinese morals of his day, he sought consolation in
playing on the “musical stone.” A peasant who noted
this in passing by, exclaimed, as he heard the sounds:
“Full indeed is the heart of him who beats the musical
stone like that!”<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>A jade ornament greatly favored by the Maoris of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
New Zealand bore the name <i>hei-tiki</i> (“a carved image for
the neck”). The ornaments of this class are very rude
and grotesque representations of the human face or
form, and were generally regarded as schematically
figuring some departed ancestor. The head sometimes
slanted right or left, so that the eyes, which were very
large and occasionally inlaid with mother-of-pearl, were
on an angle of forty-five degrees. These ornaments were
prized not only as memorials, but because, having been
worn by successive ancestors, they were supposed to communicate
something of the very being of those ancestors
to such descendants as were privileged to wear the treasured
heirloom in their turn. In many cases, when the
family was dying out, the last male member would leave
directions that his <i>hei-tiki</i> should be buried with him,
so that it might not fall into the hands of strangers.<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>So rare was this New Zealand jade, known to the
Maoris as <i lang="mi">punamu</i> (green-stone), that the aid of a
<i lang="mi">tohunga</i>, or wizard, was regarded as necessary to learn
where it could be found. On setting forth on a search
for this material, the jade-seekers would take with them
a <i lang="mi">tohunga</i>, and when the party reached the region where
jade was usually found the <i lang="mi">tohunga</i> would retire to some
solitary spot and would fall into a trance. On awaking
he would claim that the spirit of some person, dead or
living, had appeared to him and had directed to search in
a particular place for the jade. He would then conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the party to this place, where a larger or smaller piece of
jade was invariably found. Of course the wizard had
previously assured himself of the presence of the stone
in the place indicated.</p>

<p>To this jade was given the name of the man whose
spirit had revealed its location, and in many cases the
grotesque form given to the stone was conceived to represent
this man. We can easily understand the reverence
accorded to the <i lang="mi">hei-tikis</i> when we consider that they were
not only prized as heirlooms, which had been handed
down by the successive heads of the family, but were also
believed to have been originally found in such a mysterious
way.</p>

<p>When the head of the family died, his <i lang="mi">hei-tiki</i> was
generally buried with his body, but was exhumed after a
shorter or longer time by the nearest male relative. As
we have noted, if no representative of the family
remained, the heirloom was allowed to remain in the
grave. The fact that tribal or intertribal feuds sometimes
arose in regard to the possession of a <i lang="mi">hei-tiki</i>
serves to prove the peculiar virtues ascribed to them.</p>

<p>While there can be little doubt that the heirloom was
supposed to represent, in a very general way, the person
whose name it bore, the particular form given it was
largely determined by the natural shape of the mass,
which was slowly and patiently fashioned into the form
it eventually acquired. Though this was mainly due to
the imperfect means of which the artist disposed, there
was probably a conviction that the form of the natural
stone was not the result of accident, but was in itself
significant and required only to be rendered more clear
and definite. The fabrication of the <i lang="mi">hei-tikis</i> of the
Maoris is said to have ceased in the early part of the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
century. The greater number of those that have been
collected in New Zealand appear to have been made from
one hundred to one hundred and fifty years ago.<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Jasper</h3>

<p>The jasper had great repute in ancient times as a
rain-bringer, and the fourth century author of “Lithica”
celebrates this quality in the following lines:<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The gods propitious hearken to his prayers,</div>
  <div class="verse">Whoe’er the polished grass-green jasper wears;</div>
  <div class="verse">His parched glebe they’ll satiate with rain,</div>
  <div class="verse">And send for showers to soak the thirsty plain.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Evidently the green hue of this translucent stone suggested
its association with the verdure of the fields in an
even closer degree than was the case with transparent
green stones such as the emerald, etc. Another early
authority, Damigeron, mentions this belief, and states
that only when properly consecrated would the jasper do
service in this way.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Jasper was also credited in the
fourth century with the virtue of driving away evil spirits
and protecting those who wore it from the bites of venomous
creatures.<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> An anonymous German author of the
eleventh or twelfth century recommends the use of this
stone for the cure of snake bites, and states that if it
be placed upon the bitten part the matter will come out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
from the wound.<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Here the cure is operated, not by the
absorbent quality of the stone, but by its supposed power
to attract poison or venom to itself, thus removing the
cause of disease.</p>

<p>A popular etymology of the Greek and Latin name
for jasper is reported by Bartolomæus Anglicus, who
writes that “in the head of an adder that hyght Aspis
is founde a lytyl stone that is called Jaspis.” The same
authority pronounces this stone to be of “wunder vertue,”
and says that “it hath as many vertues as dyvers
coloures and veines.”<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> This is fully in accord with
tradition, for, as color was at least as important as chemical
composition in determining the talismanic or therapeutic
worth of the different stones, the great variety
of colors and markings in the different jaspers naturally
indicated their use in many different ways.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Jet</h3>

<p>Jet has been found among the palæolithic remains in
the caves of the “Kesslerloch,” near Thayngen, Canton
Schaffhausen, Switzerland. The material was evidently
derived from the deposits in Würtemberg and was shaped
by flint chips. Quite possibly jet, as well as amber, was
already regarded as possessing a certain talismanic virtue.
Such ornaments, when worn, were believed to become
a part of the very body and soul of the wearer, and
were therefore to be guarded with jealous care.<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
palæolithic cave-deposits of Belgium also, jet appears,
the supply being in this instance derived from northern
Lorraine. The fragments had been rounded and pierced
through the centre.<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> This indicates their use as parts
of a necklace or as pendants. Necklaces, bracelets, and
rings were especially favored for the wearing of talismanic
gems, since the stones could easily be so set that
they would come in direct contact with the skin.</p>

<p>Jet was one of the materials used by the Pueblo
Indians for their amulets. An exceptionally well-executed
figure of a frog made of this material was found
in Pueblo Bonito, in 1896, by Mr. Pepper. The representation
is much more realistic than is the case in the
other figures of this type from this region. Turquoise
eyes have been inserted in the head of the figure and a
band of turquoise surrounds the neck.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Lapis-Lazuli</h3>

<p>Both in Babylonia and in Egypt, lapis-lazuli was very
highly valued, and this is shown by the use of its Assyrian
name (<i>uknu</i>) in poetic metaphor. Thus, in a hymn
to the moon-god Sin, he is addressed as the “strong bull,
great of horns, perfect in form, with long flowing beard,
bright as lapis-lazuli.”<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> This may remind us of the
“hyacinthine locks” of classical literature.</p>

<p>Lapis-lazuli, “a blue stone with little golden spots,”
was a cure for melancholy and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> “quartern fever,”
an intermittent fever returning each third day, or each
fourth day counting in the previous attack.<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<h3 class="h3l">Loadstone</h3>

<p>We have the authority of Plato (Ion, 533 D) for the
statement that the word <i>magnetis</i> was first applied to the
loadstone by the tragic poet Euripides (480-405 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>),
the more usual name being “the Heraclean stone.”
These designations refer to two places in Lydia, Magnesia
and Herakleia, where the mineral was found.<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>
Pliny states, on the authority of Nicander, that a certain
Magnes, a shepherd, discovered the mineral on Mount
Ida, while pasturing his flock, because the nails of his

<p>We are told by Pliny that Ptolemy Philadelphus (309-247
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), planning to erect a temple in honor of his sister
and wife Arsinoë, called in the aid of Chirocrates, an
Alexandrian architect. The latter engaged to place
therein an iron statue of Arsinoë which should appear to
hang in mid-air without support. However, both the
Egyptian king and his architect died before the design
could be realized.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> This story of an image held in suspense
by means of powerful magnets set in the floor and
roof, and sometimes also in the walls of a temple, is
repeated in a variety of forms by early writers. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
course, there was no real foundation for such tales, as
the thing is altogether impracticable.</p>

<p>The Roman poet Claudian (fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) relates
that the priests of a certain temple, in order to offer a
dramatic spectacle to the eyes of the worshippers, caused
two statues to be executed,—one of Mars in iron, and
another of Venus in loadstone. At a special festival these
statues were placed near to each other, and the loadstone
drew the iron to itself. Claudian vividly describes this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The priests prepare a marriage feast.</div>
  <div class="verse">Behold a marvel! Instant to her arms</div>
  <div class="verse">Her eager husband Cythereia charms;</div>
  <div class="verse">And ever mindful of her ancient fires,</div>
  <div class="verse">With amorous breath his martial breast inspires;</div>
  <div class="verse">Lifts the loved weight, close round his helmet twines</div>
  <div class="verse">Her loving arms, and close embraces joins,</div>

  <div class="verse">Flies to the wedded gem the God of War.</div>
  <div class="verse">The Magnet weds the Steel: the sacred rites</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>There was current as early as the fourth century a
curious belief that a piece of loadstone, if placed beneath
the pillow of a sleeping wife, would act as a touchstone
of her virtue. This first appears in the Alexandrian
poem “Lithica,” and it has been thus quaintly Englished
by a fourteenth century translator:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Also magnes is in lyke wyse as adamas; yf it be sett under the
heed of a chaste wyfe, it makyth her sodenly to beclyppe [embrace]
her husbonde; &amp; yf she be a spowse breker, she shall meve her oute
of the bed sodenly by drede of fantasy.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>The same writer attempts an explanation of the popular
fancy that when powdered loadstone was thrown
upon coals in the four corners of a house, the inmates
would feel as though the house were falling down; of
this he says: “That seemynge is by mevynge [moving]
that comyth by tornynge of the brayn.”<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>In classical writings the fascination exercised by a
very beautiful woman is sometimes likened to the attractive
power of the loadstone, as notably by Lucian,<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> who
says that if such a woman looks at a man she draws him
to her, and leads him whither she will, just as the
loadstone draws the iron. To the same idea is probably
due the fact that in several languages the name given
to the loadstone indicates that its peculiar power was
conceived to be a manifestation of the sympathy or love
of one mineral substance for another. This is commonly
believed to be the sense in which we should understand
the French designation <i lang="fr">aimant</i>, namely, as the participle
of the verb <i lang="fr">aimer</i>, “to love”; however, some etymologists
prefer to derive the word from <i lang="la">adamas</i>, sometimes
used in Low Latin for the loadstone, although properly
signifying the diamond. It is certainly worthy of note
that in two such dissimilar languages as Sanskrit and
Chinese, the influence of this idea appears in the names
given to the loadstone. In Sanskrit the word is <i lang="sa">chumbaka</i>
or “the kisser,” and in Chinese <i lang="zh">t’ su shi</i>, or “the
loving-stone.” Chin T’sang Khi, a Chinese author of
the eighth century, wrote that “the loadstone attracts
iron just as does a tender mother when she calls her
children to her.”<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>A rich growth of Mohammedan legends grew up about
the exploits of Alexander the Great, a striking example
being given on another page, and in one of them it is related
that the Greek world-conqueror provided his soldiers
with loadstones as a defence against the wiles of the
jinns, or evil spirits; the loadstone, as well as magnetized
iron, being regarded as a sure defence against enchantments
and all the machinations of malignant spirits.<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>In the East Indies it is said that a king should have a
seat of loadstone at his coronation; probably because the
magnetic influence of the stone was supposed to attract
power, favor, and gifts to the sovereign. But it is not
only in the Orient that magnetite is prized for its talismanic
powers, for even in some parts of our own land this
belief is still prevalent. Large quantities of loadstone
are found at Magnet Cove, Arkansas, and it is estimated
that from one to three tons are sold annually to the
negroes to be used in the Voodoo ceremonies as conjuring
stones. The material has been found in land used for
farming purposes, and many pieces have been turned up
in ploughing for corn; these vary from the size of a pea
to masses weighing from ten to twenty pounds. They
occur in a reddish-brown, sticky soil; their surface is
smooth and brown and they have the appearance of water-worn
pebbles. In July, 1887, an interesting case was tried
in Macon, Georgia, where a negro woman sued a conjuror
to recover five dollars which she had paid him for
a piece of loadstone to serve as a charm to bring back
her wandering husband. As the market value of this
mineral was only seventy-five cents a pound, and the piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
was very small, weighing but a few ounces, the judge
ordered that the money should be refunded.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Malachite</h3>

<p>For some reason not easy to fathom, malachite was
considered to be a talisman peculiarly appropriate for
children. If a piece of this stone were attached to an
infant’s cradle, all evil spirits were held aloof and the
child slept soundly and peacefully.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> In some parts of
Germany, malachite shared with turquoise the repute of
protecting the wearer from danger in falling, and it also
gave warning of approaching disaster by breaking into
several pieces.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> This material was well known to the
ancient Egyptians, malachite mines having been worked
between Suez and Sinai as early as 4000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The appropriate design to be engraved upon malachite
was the image of the sun. Such a gem became a
powerful talisman and protected the wearer from enchantments,
from evil spirits, and from the attacks of
venomous creatures.<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> The sun, as the source of all light,
was generally regarded as the deadly enemy of necromancers,
witches, and demons, who delighted in the darkness
and feared nothing more than the bright light of day.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Moonstone</h3>

<p>The moonstone is believed to bring good fortune and
is regarded as a sacred stone in India. It is never displayed
for sale there, except on a yellow cloth, as yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
is an especially sacred color. As a gift for lovers the
moonstone takes a high rank, for it is believed to arouse
the tender passion, and to give lovers the power to read
in the future the fortune, good or ill, that is in store for
them. To gain this knowledge, however, the stone must
be placed in the mouth while the moon is full.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>Antoine Mizauld<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> tells us of a selenite or moonstone
owned by a friend of his, a great traveller. This stone,
about the size of the gold piece known as the gold noble,
but somewhat thicker, indicated the waxing and waning
of the moon by a certain white point or mark which grew
larger or smaller as did the moon. Mizauld relates that
to convince himself of the truth of this he obtained possession
of the stone for one lunar month, during which
time he sedulously observed it. The white mark first
appeared at the top. It was like a small millet-seed, increasing
in size and moving down on the stone, always
assuming the form of the moon until, on reaching the
middle, it was round like the full moon; then the mark
gradually passed up again as the moon diminished. The
owner declared that he had “vowed and dedicated this
stone to the young king [Edward VI], who was then
highly esteemed because he had good judgment in regard
to rare and precious things.”</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Onyx</h3>

<p>The onyx, if worn on the neck, was said to cool the
ardors of love, and Cardano relates that everywhere in
India the stone was worn for this purpose.<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> This belief
is closely related to the idea commonly associated with the
onyx,—namely, that it provoked discord and separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
lovers. The close union and yet the strange contrast between
the layers of black and white may have suggested
this.</p>

<h3 class="h3l">Pyrites</h3>

<p>Crystals of iron pyrites (pyrite, native iron disulphide)
are sometimes used as amulets by the North
American Indians, and the
belief in their magic power
is attested by their presence
in the outfit of miscellaneous
objects which the medicine-men
use in the course
of their incantations. Because
these gleaming yellow
crystals are occasionally
mistaken for gold, the
name “fool’s gold” has
been popularly bestowed
upon them.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Of this material the
ancient Mexicans made
wonderful mirrors, one side
being usually polished
flat, while the other side
was strongly convex. Frequently

<h3 class="h3l">Rock-crystal</h3>

<p>The popular belief in his time as to the origin of rock-crystal
is voiced by St. Jerome, when, using the words
of Pliny, although not citing his authority, he says that
it was formed by the congelation of water in dark caverns
of the mountains, where the temperature was intensely
cold, so that, “While a stone to the touch, it seems like
water to the eye.” This belief was evidently due to the
fact that rock-crystal was so often found in mountain
clefts and caverns. Symbolically, it signified that those
within the portals of the Church should keep themselves
free from stain and have a pure faith.<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The Chinese emperor Wu was devoted to the service
of the gods and of the immortal spirits. He built many
edifices for religious purposes, and all the doors of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
buildings were made of white rock-crystal, so that a flood
of light poured into the interior. Although the Chinese
texts call this material rock-crystal, it is possible that the
name was applied to glass when that substance was but
recently introduced into China.<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>Regarding this same “rock-crystal” a humorous tale
is related. Muan-fen, a mandarin who had a great terror
of draughts, was once received in the palace by one of the
Chinese emperors. The doors of the audience chamber
were of rock-crystal and were tightly closed, but, because
of the transparency of the material, they seemed to be
wide open, and the emperor was greatly amused to note
that Muan-fen was shivering with cold, although the temperature
of the room was quite comfortable.<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

skull carved out of rock-crystal. It weighs 475¼ ounces

<h3 class="h3l">Ruby</h3>

<p>The ruby has many names in Sanskrit, some of them
clearly showing that it was more valued as a gem by the
Hindus than any other. For instance, it is called <i lang="sa">ratnaraj</i>,
“king of precious stones,” and <i lang="sa">ratnanâyaka</i>,
“leader of precious stones;” another name, applied to a
particular shade of ruby is <i lang="sa">padmarâga</i>, “red as the
lotus.”<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>The glowing hue of the ruby suggested the idea that
an inextinguishable flame burned in this stone. From
this fancy came the assertion that the inner fire could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
be hidden, as it would shine through the clothing or
through any material that might be wrapped around the
stone.<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> If cast into the water the ruby communicated its
heat to the liquid, causing it to boil. The dark and the
star rubies were called “male” stones, the others, more
especially, however, those of lighter hue, being considered
as “female” stones. All varieties served to
preserve the bodily and mental health of the wearer, for
they removed evil thoughts, controlled amorous desires,
dissipated pestilential vapors, and reconciled disputes.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>In the “Lapidaire” of Philippe de Valois, it is said
that “the books tell us the beautiful clear and fine ruby
is the lord of stones; it is the gem of gems, and surpasses
all other precious stones in virtue.” In the time of Marbodus
(end of the eleventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) the same proud
place was assigned to the sapphire. The ruby is spoken
of in similar terms in the “Lapidaire en Vers,” where it
is called “the most precious of the twelve stones God
created when He created all creatures”. By Christ’s
command the ruby was placed on Aaron’s neck, “the
ruby, called the lord of gems; the highly prized, the dearly
loved ruby, so fair with its gay color.”<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>As with diamonds, rubies also were divided by the
Hindus into four castes. The true Oriental ruby was
a Brahmin; the rubicelle, a Kshatriya; the spinel, a Vaisya,
and lastly, the balas-ruby, a Sudra. The possession of a
<i lang="sa">padmarâga</i>, or Brahmin ruby, conferred perfect safety
upon the owner, and as long as he owned this precious
stone he could dwell without fear in the midst of enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and was shielded from adverse fortune. However, great
care had to be taken to preserve this ruby of the first
class from contact with inferior specimens, as its virtue
would thereby be contaminated, and its power for good
correspondingly diminished.<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>The many talismanic virtues of the ruby are noted in
the fourteenth century treatise attributed to Sir John
Mandeville.<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Here the fortunate owner of a brilliant
ruby is assured that he will live in peace and concord with
all men, that neither his land nor his rank will be taken
from him, and that he will be preserved from all perils.
The stone would also guard his house, his fruit-trees, and
his vineyards from injury by tempests. All the good
effects were most surely secured if the ruby, set in ring,
bracelet, or brooch, were worn on the left side.</p>

<p>The gorgeous ruby, the favorite gem of Burma, where
the finest specimens are found, is not only valued for its
beauty, but is also believed to confer invulnerability. To
attain this end, however, it is not thought to be sufficient
to wear these stones in a ring or other piece of jewelry,
but the stone must be inserted in the flesh, and thus become,
so to speak, a part of its owner’s body. Those who
in this way bear about with them a ruby, confidently believe
that they cannot be wounded by spear, sword, or
gun.<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> As it is often remarked that the most daring and
reckless soldiers pass unscathed through all the perils of
war, we can understand that this superstition may sometimes
appear to be verified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Sapphire</h3>

<p>The sapphire is noted as a regal gem by Damigeron,
who asserts that kings wore it about their necks as a
powerful defence from harm. The stone preserved the
wearer from envy and attracted divine favor.<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> For royal
use, sapphires were set in bracelets and necklaces, and the
sacred character of the stone was attested by the tradition
that the Law given to Moses on the Mount was
engraved on tablets of sapphire.<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> While we should probably
translate here “lapis-lazuli” instead of “sapphire,”
all such passages were later understood as referring to
the true sapphire, which is not found in pieces of the
requisite size.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century, the Bishop of Rennes lavishes
encomiums upon this beautiful stone. It is quite natural
that this writer should lay especial stress upon the use of
the sapphire for the adornment of rings, for it was in his
time that it was beginning to be regarded as the stone
most appropriate for ecclesiastical rings. The sapphire
was like the pure sky, and mighty Nature had endowed
it with so great a power that it might be called sacred
and the gem of gems. Fraud was banished from its presence
and necromancers honored it more than any other
stone, for it enabled them to hear and to understand the
obscurest oracles.<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

</div>
<p>The traditional virtue of the sapphire as an antidote
against poison is noted by Bartolomæus Anglicus, who
claims to have seen a test of its power, somewhat similar
to that recorded by Ahmed Teifashi of the emerald. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
John of Trevisa’s version this passage reads as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>His vertue is contrary to venym, and quencheth it every deale.
And yf you put an attercoppe<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> in a boxe and hold a very saphyre of
Inde at the mouth of the boxe ony whyle, by vertue thereof the attercoppe
is overcome &amp; dyeth as it were sodenly, as Dyasc. sayth [pseudo
Dioscorides]. And this same I have assayed oft in many and dyvers
places. His vertue kepeth and savyth the syght, &amp; clearyth eyen of
fylthe wythout ony greyf.</p></blockquote>

<p>Voicing the general belief that the sapphire was endowed
with power to influence spirits, Bartolomæus says
that this stone was a great favorite with those who practised
necromancy, and he adds: “Also wytches love well
this stone, for they wene that they may werke certen
wondres by vertue of this stone.”<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>There was in the South Kensington Museum, in London,
a splendid sapphire of a peculiar tint. In the daylight
it shows a beautiful rich blue color, while by artificial
light it has a violet hue and resembles an amethyst. In
the eighteenth century this stone was in the collection
of Count de Walicki, a Polish nobleman, and Mme. de
Genlis used it as the theme of one of her stories, entitled
“Le Saphire Merveilleux.” Here the sapphire is used
as a test of female virtue, the change of color indicating
unfaithfulness on the part of the wearer. If the owner of
the stone wished to prove that the subject of the test was
innocent, she was made to wear the sapphire for three
hours of daylight; but in the opposite case the test was so
timed that it began in daylight and ended when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
candles or lamps had been lighted. This sapphire, still
known as the “Saphire Merveilleux,” was for a time in
the collection of the Duke of Orleans, who bore the name
of Philippe Egalité during the French Revolution.</p>

<p>The star sapphire is that variety of sapphire in which,
when the stone is cut and rounded off horizontal with the
dome of the crystal, the light is condensed across the three
lines of crystalline interference. Three cross lines produce
a star which moves as a source of light, or as it is
moved from the source of light. Star sapphires very
rarely possess the deep blue color of the fine blue sapphire;
generally the color is somewhat impure, or of a
milky-blue, or else a blue-gray, or sometimes almost a
pure white. The blue-gray, gray, and white stones frequently
show a much more distinct star, possibly from
the fact that there are more inclusions between the layers
of the crystals than with the darker blue stones, as it is
the set of interference bands that produces the peculiar
light. Just as the eye agate was used in some countries
to preserve against the Evil Eye, so the moving star is
believed by the Cingalese to serve as a protection and
a guard against witchcraft of all kinds.</p>

<p>The great Oriental traveller, Sir Richard Francis
Burton, had a large star sapphire or asteria, as it was
called. He referred to it as his talisman, for it always
brought him good horses and prompt attention wherever
he went; in fact, it was only in those places where he
received proper attention that he would show it to the natives,
a favor they greatly appreciated, because the sight
of the stone was believed to bring good luck. The fame
of Burton’s asteria travelled ahead of him, and it served
him well as a guiding-star. De Boot, writing in the
seventeenth century, states that such a stone was called
Siegstein (victory-stone) among the Germans.</p>

<p>The remarkable asteria, known as the “Star of India,”
in the Morgan-Tiffany Collection in the American
Museum of Natural History, has a more or less indefinite
historic record of some three centuries, but after its many
wanderings it has now found a worthy resting-place in
the great Museum. Its weight is 543 carats.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>The asteria, or star sapphire, might be called a “Stone
of Destiny,” as the three cross-bars which traverse it
are believed to represent Faith, Hope, and Destiny. As
the stone is moved, or the light changes, a living star appears.
As a guiding gem, warding off ill omen and the
Evil Eye, the star-sapphire is worn for the same reasons
as were the <i lang="la">oculus mundi</i> and the <i lang="la">oculus Beli</i>. One of
the most unique of talismanic stones, it is said to be so
potent that it continues to exercise its good influence
over the first wearer even when it has passed into other
hands.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Sard</h3>

<p>The sard was regarded as a protection against incantations
and sorcery, and was believed to sharpen the wits
of the wearer, rendering him fearless, victorious, and
happy.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The red hue of this stone was supposed to
neutralize the malign influence of the dark onyx, driving
away the bad dreams caused by the latter and dispelling
the melancholy thoughts it inspired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Serpentine</h3>

<p>The Italian peasants of to-day believe that pebbles
of green serpentine afford protection from the bites of
venomous creatures. These stones are usually green with
streaks or veins of white, and the name was derived from
their fancied resemblance to a serpent’s skin. In addition
to their prophylactic powers, if any one has been
bitten by such a creature, the stone, when applied to the
wound, is supposed to draw out the poison. Here, as
in the case of coral, the hand of man must not have shaped
the amulet; it should be in its natural state. As a general
rule, however, the belief that the touch of any iron
instrument, such as the tool of the gem-cutter, destroys
the magic efficacy of the substance, is less firmly held in
regard to stones than in reference to coral.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<h3 class="h3l">Turquoise</h3>

<p>While there was a tendency to attribute the virtues
originally ascribed to one particular stone to others of
the same or similar color and appearance, certain stones
were regarded as possessing special virtues not commonly
attributed to others. A notable instance of this is
the quality supposed to inhere in the turquoise. This
stone was known in Egypt from a very early period and
is later described by Pliny under the name of <i>callais</i>.
For Pliny, and for all those who derived their information
from him or from the sources he used, the turquoise
only participated in the virtues assigned to all blue or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
greenish-blue stones; but from the thirteenth century,
when the name turquoise was first employed, we read that
the stone possessed the power to protect the wearer from
injury by falling, more especially from horseback; later,
this was extended to cover falls from a building or over
a precipice. A fourteenth century authority, the “Lapidaire”
of Sir John Mandeville, states that the turquoise
protected horses from the ill-effects resulting from drinking
cold water when overheated by exertion, and it is said
that the Turks often attached these stones to the bridles
and frontlets of their horses as amulets. They are
also so used in Samarcand and Persia. We might therefore
be justified in supposing that the turquoise was
originally used in the East as a “horse-amulet,” and the
belief in its power to protect from falls may have arisen
from the idea that it rendered the horse more sure-footed
and enduring. As the horse was often regarded as a
symbol of the sun in its rapid course through the blue
heavens, the celestial hue of the turquoise may have
caused it to be associated in some way with the horse.
We can only hazard this as a plausible conjecture.</p>

<p>Probably the earliest notice of the peculiar superstition
in regard to the turquoise—namely, that it preserves
the wearer from injury in case of falling—is contained
in Volmar’s thirteenth century “Steinbuch,”
where we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whoever owns the true turquoise set in gold will not injure any
of his limbs when he falls, whether he be riding or walking, so long as
he has the stone with him.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Anselmus de Boot, court physician of Emperor
Rudolph II, tells a story of a turquoise that, after being
thirty years in the possession of a Spaniard, was offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
for sale with the rest of the owner’s property. Every
one was amazed to find it had entirely lost its color;
nevertheless De Boot’s father bought it for a trifling
sum. On his return home, however, ashamed to wear so
mean-looking a gem, he gave it to his son, saying, “Son,
as the virtues of the turquoise are said to exist only when
the stone has been given, I will try its efficacy by bestowing
it upon thee.” Little appreciating the gift, the recipient
had his arms engraved on it as though it had been
only a common agate and wore it as a signet. He had
scarcely worn it a month, however, before it resumed its
pristine beauty and daily seemed to increase in splendor.
Could we accept this statement as true we would have
here an altogether unique instance of the recovery by a
turquoise of the blue color it had lost.</p>

<p>Not long after, the powers of De Boot’s turquoise
were put to the test. As he was returning to Bohemia
from Padua, where he had just taken his degree, he was
forced to traverse a narrow and dangerous road at night.
Suddenly his horse stumbled and threw him heavily to
the ground, but, strange to say, neither horse nor rider
was injured by the fall. Next morning, while washing his
hands, De Boot remarked that about a quarter of his turquoise
had broken away. Nevertheless the stone did not
lose its virtue. Some time afterward, when the wearer
was lifting a very heavy pole, he felt all at once a sharp
pain in his side and heard his ribs crack, so that he
feared he had injured himself seriously. However, it
turned out that he had not broken any bones but had
simply strained himself; but, on looking at his turquoise,
he saw that it had again broken into two pieces.<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>A singular virtue ascribed to the turquoise was that
of striking the hour correctly, if the stone were suspended
from a thread held between the thumb and index-finger
in such a way that a slight vibration would make
the stone strike against the side of a glass. De Boot
states that he made the experiment successfully, but he
very sensibly explains the apparent wonder by the unconscious
effect of the mind on the body. The expectation
that the stone was going to strike a certain number of
times induced an involuntary movement of the hand.<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The turquoise seems to have been worn almost exclusively
by men at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, for De Boot, writing in 1609, said that it was so
highly regarded by men that no man considered his hand
to be well adorned unless he wore a fine turquoise.
Women, however, rarely wore this gem.<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> This custom
was much in vogue among the Englishmen who travelled
in the Orient, until a score of years ago.</p>

<p>The Persians fully appreciate the beauty and power
of this, their national stone, and they have a saying that
to escape evil and attain good fortune one must see the
reflection of the new moon either on the face of a friend,
on a copy of the Koran, or on a turquoise,<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> thus ranking
this stone with two most precious things, a friend and the
source and warrant of religion. Possibly we should take
this proverbial saying to indicate that whoever has a true
friend, a copy of the sacred volume or a turquoise will
be preserved from harm.</p>

<p>The turquoise of the Los Cerillos mines in New
Mexico is rudely extracted by building large fires at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
base of the rock until it becomes heated, when cold water
is dashed over it, the sharp change of temperature splitting
up the rock. Some of the fragmentary material
thus secured is worked up in the region into heart-shaped
ornaments, or amulets, locally called malacates. The
religious veneration with which many of the New Mexico
Indians still regard the turquoise was noted by Major
Hyde, when he explored the region in 1880, for some
Pueblo Indians from Santo Domingo, New Mexico, expressed
strong disapproval of his action in extracting
turquoise from the old mine, as they looked upon this as
a sacred stone which should not pass into the possession
of those whose Saviour was not a Montezuma.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>The ruins called Los Muertos, situated nine miles
from Tempe, Arizona, have furnished a peculiarly interesting
amulet or fetish of Zuñi workmanship. This
is a seashell which has been coated with black pitch, in
which are encrusted turquoises and garnets so disposed
in mosaic as to represent clearly enough the figure of a
toad, the sacred emblem of the Zuñis.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>The sacred character with which this stone was invested
is shown by the wealth of turquoise ornaments
found in some of the burials, notably in those of Pueblo
Bonito, unearthed by Mr. George H. Pepper in 1896.<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
This is one of the Chaco Cañon groups of ruins, in the
northwestern part of New Mexico. In one case nearly
nine thousand beads and pendants of turquoise were
found on or about a single skeleton. There was abun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>dant
evidence in the special care bestowed upon the
burial that the deceased must have been a man of high
rank, and the condition of the skull plainly indicated
that he had met a violent death. The 1980 beads found
on the breast of the skeleton are believed to have been
strung as a necklace, and the position of other masses
of these beads renders it probable that they had been
used for bracelets or anklets, the strings having decayed
and disappeared in the course of time. The most
interesting of the turquoise objects are, however, the
pendants worked into various forms designed to favor the
entrance of some guardian spirit into the stone. In this
single burial were found pendants shaped more or less
roughly into the forms of a rabbit, a bird, an insect (?),
a human foot and a shoe. Around another burial
in the same chamber were strewn nearly six thousand
turquoise beads and pendants.<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> In all 24,932 beads
were found in these burials.</p>

<p>Another very interesting object from Pueblo Bonito,
and one having probably a special ceremonial use and
value, is a turquoise basket,—that is to say, a cylindrical
basket three inches in diameter and six inches long, originally
made of slender splints with a coating of gum in
which 1214 small pieces of turquoise have been set. These
are very closely set and form a complete mosaic covering
for the object. The legends of the Navahos contain allusions
to “turquoise jewel baskets,” and Mr. Pepper
raises the question whether or no this can refer to those
made by the Pueblo Indians.<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The Apache name for the turquoise is <i lang="apa">duklij</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
signifies either a green or a blue stone, no distinction
being made between the two colors. This stone is highly
prized for its talismanic virtues. Indeed the possession
of a turquoise was indispensable for a medicine-man, as
without it he would not receive proper recognition. That
some of the powers of the thunder-stone were ascribed
to the turquoise by the tribes appears from the fancy
that a man who could go to the end of a rainbow after
a storm and search in the damp earth would find a turquoise.
One of its supposed powers was to aid the
warrior or hunter by assuring the accuracy of his aim,
for if a turquoise were affixed to a gun or bow the shot
sped from the weapon would go straight to the mark.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>A lady prominent in the London world is said to possess
the power of restoring to their pristine hue turquoises
that have grown pale. According to report, this
lady is often called upon to use her peculiar gift by
friends whose turquoises have faded.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> While the improvement
supposed to be noted may be more imaginary
than real in many cases, there is little doubt that this
stone is exceptionally sensitive to the action of certain
emanations, and may, at times, be influenced by the
wearer’s general state of health. The writer believes
that a turquoise, like an egg, can never be restored to its
original state.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a><br />

<small>On the Use of Engraved and Carved Gems as
Talismans</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">The virtue believed to be inherent in precious stones
was thought to gain an added potency when the
stone was engraved with some symbol or figure possessing
a special sacredness, or denoting and typifying a
special quality. This presupposes a considerable development
of civilization, since the art of engraving on
precious stones offers many mechanical difficulties and
thus requires a high degree of artistic and mechanical
skill. It is true that the earliest engraved stones, the
Babylonian cylinders and the Egyptian scarabs, were
both designed to serve an eminently practical purpose as
well, namely, that of seals; but in a great number of instances
these primitive seals were looked upon as endowed
with talismanic power, and were worn on the
person as talismans.</p>

<p>The scarab, so highly favored by the Egyptians as an
ornamental form, is a representation of the <i>scarabæus
sacer</i>, the typical genus of the family <i>Scarabæidæ</i>. They
are usually black, but occasionally show a fine play of
metallic colors. After gathering up a clump of dung for
the reception of the eggs, the insect rolls this along, using
the hind legs to propel it, until the material, at first soft
and of irregular form, becomes hardened and almost perfectly
round. A curious symbolism induced the Egyptians
to find in this beetle an emblem of the world of
fatherhood and of man. The round ball wherein the eggs
were deposited typified the world, and, as the Egyptians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
thought that the scarabæi were all males, they especially
signified the male principle in generation, becoming
types of fatherhood and man. At the same time, as only
full-grown beetles were observed, it was believed these
creatures represented a regeneration or reincarnation,
since it was not realized that the eggs or larval and
pupa stages had anything to do with the generation of
the beetle. Thus the scarab was used as a symbol of
immortality.</p>

<p>While, however, this was the popular view, it seems
unlikely that such close observers as were the more cultured
Egyptians should have been entirely unfamiliar
with the real genesis of the <i>Scarabæus sacer</i>; but, in this
case also, there would have been no difficulty in finding it
emblematic of immortality in the various stages through
which it passed. The larval stage might well signify the
mortal life; the pupa stage, the intermediate period represented
by the mummy, with which the soul was conceived
to be vaguely connected, in spite of its wanderings
through the nether-world; and, lastly, the fully developed
beetle could be regarded as a type of the rebirth into
everlasting life, when the purified and perfected soul
again animated the original and transfigured form in a
mysterious resurrection.</p>

<p>Scarabs are frequently engraved with the hieroglyph
<span class="xl">☥</span>(<i>anch</i>, “life”) and <img src="images/i_116a.jpg" alt="hieroglyph" /> (<i>ha</i>, “increase of power”).
The emblem of stability <img src="images/i_116b.jpg"  alt="hieroglyph" /> (<i>tet</i>) is also employed, as
well as many others. In addition to these simple symbols,
many scarabs bear legends supposed to render them
exceptionally luck-bringing. The following are characteristic
specimens.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p><img src="images/i_117a.jpg" alt="3 hieroglyphs" /> <i lang="egy">maat ankh neb</i>, “Lord of Truth and Life.”</p>

<p><img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="4 hieroglyph3" /> “abounding in graces” (very deeply cut
as a seal).</p>

<p>“May thy name be established; mayst thou have a
son.”</p>

<p><img src="images/i_117c.jpg" alt="2 hieroglyph" /> (within ornamental border), “good stability.”</p>

<p><img src="images/i_117d.jpg" alt="3 hieroglyph" /> <i lang="egy">ikht neb nefer</i>, “All good things.”</p>

<p>(Inlaid). “A good day” (a holiday).</p>

<p>“A mother is a truly good thing” or “Truth is a good
Mother.”</p>

<p>The scarab, for the Egyptians a type of the rising
sun and hence of the renewal of life after death, was
copied by the Phœnicians from the Egyptian types and
modified in various ways to suit the religious fancies of
the various lands to which they bore the products of their
art. Much of the original significance of this symbol
must have been lost; probably in many cases little was
left but a vague idea that an amulet of this form would
bring good luck to the wearer and guard from harm.</p>

<p>Funeral scarabs were often made of jasper, amethyst,
lapis-lazuli, ruby, or carnelian, with the names of gods,
kings, priests, officials, or private persons engraved on
the base; occasionally monograms or floral devices were
engraved. Sometimes the base of the scarab was heart-shaped
and at others the scarab was combined with the
“utat,” or eye of Horus, and also with the frog, typifying
revivification. Set in rings they were placed on the
fingers of the dead, or else, wrapped in linen bandages,
they rested on the heart of the deceased, a type of the
sun which rose each day to renewed life. They were
symbols of the resurrection of the body.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>Some of the Egyptian scarabs were evidently used as
talismanic gifts from one friend to another. Two such
scarabs are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York. One bears the inscription “May Ra
grant you a happy New Year,” the text of the other
reading as follows: “May your name be established,
may you have a son,” and “May your house flourish
every day.” It is a curious fact that the modern greeting
“Happy New Year” was current in Egypt probably
three thousand years ago.<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>On the Egyptian inscribed scarabs used as signets
were engraved many of the symbols to which a talismanic
virtue was attributed. The uræus serpent, signifying
death, is sometimes associated with the knot, the so-called
<i>ankh</i> symbol, denoting life. Often the hieroglyph for
<i>nub</i>, gold, appears; this symbol is a necklace with pendant
beads, showing that gold beads must have been known
in Egypt in the early days when the hieroglyph for gold
was first used. All these symbolic figures, of which a
great number occur, served to impart to the signet a
sacred and auspicious quality which communicated itself
to the wearer, and even to the impression made by the
seal, this in its turn acquiring a certain magic force.
Few of us would be willing to confess to a belief in the
innate power of any symbol, but the suggestive power of
a symbol is as real to-day as it ever was. Any object
that evokes a high thought or serves to emphasize a profound
conviction really possesses a kind of magical
quality, since it is capable of causing an effect out of all
proportion to its intrinsic worth or its material quality.</p>

<p>Many scarabs and signets exist made of the artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
<i>cyanus</i>, which was an imitation lapis-lazuli made in
Egypt. This was an alkaline silicate, colored a deep blue
with carbonate of copper. Often a wonderful translucent
or opaque blue glass was used. The genuine lapis-lazuli
was also used to a considerable extent for scarabs
and cylinders, in Egypt and Assyria, and gems were also
cut from it in imperial Roman times.<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> A notable instance
of the use of lapis-lazuli in ancient Egypt was as the
material for the image of Truth (<i>Ma</i>), which the
Egyptian chief-justice wore on his neck, suspended from
a golden chain.<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>In Roman times some of the legionaries are said to
have worn rings set with scarabs, for the reason that
this figure was believed to impart great courage and
vigor to the wearer.<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>The Egyptian amulets of the earliest period, up to the
XII dynasty (circa 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), differ considerably from
those made and worn after the beginning of the XVIII
dynasty (1580 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). Those of the earlier period are not
numerous and present but a small number of types, animal
forms or the heads of animals constituting the most
favored models. The precious stone materials are principally
carnelian, beryl, and amethyst. After the close of
the so-called Hyksos period, the age during which foreign
kings ruled over Egypt, came the brilliant revival and
development of Egyptian civilization that characterized
the XVIII dynasty. Some of the old forms were entirely
cast aside while others were greatly modified in form and
significance, the animal forms losing much of their fetich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>istic
quality and coming to be more and more regarded
as images of the multifarious divinities worshipped in
this later period. In many cases the animal type was
entirely or partially discarded and the amulets figured
the conventional types given to the various divinities.
However, while some of these images were wholly human,
many of them show a human body with an animal head.
Various symbolic designs were also favored, one believed
to signify the blood of Isis having the form of a knot or
tie. A frog fashioned out of lapis-lazuli and having eyes
of gold is one of these amulets of the XVIII dynasty or
later.</p>

<p>An interesting Egyptian talisman in the Louvre is
engraved with a design representing Thothmes II seizing
a lion by the tail and raising the animal aloft; at the same
time he brandishes in the other hand a club, with which
he is about to dash out the lion’s brains. The Egyptian
word <i>quen</i>, “strength,” is engraved beneath the design
and indicates that the virtue of the talisman was to increase
the strength and courage of the wearer, the inscription
being a kind of perpetual invocation to the
higher powers whose aid was sought.<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>The children of Israel, when in the desert, were said
to have engraved figures on carnelian, “just as seals are
engraved.”<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> This statement, repeated by many early
writers, may perhaps have arisen from an identification
of carnelian with the first stone of the breastplate, the
<i>odem</i>, unquestionably a red stone, and very possibly carnelian.
There can be no doubt that this was one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
first stones used for ornamental purposes and for engraving,
as a number of specimens have been preserved
from early Egyptian times. Because of the cooling and
calming effect exercised by carnelian upon the blood, if
worn on the neck or on the finger, it was believed to still
all angry passions.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>A class of amulets even older than the Egyptian
scarabs is represented by the engraved Assyrio-Babylonian
cylinders. There has been much discussion among
scholars as to the original purpose for which these cylinders
were made, some holding that they were exclusively
employed as seals or signets, while others incline to the
belief that many of them were intended only for use as
amulets or talismans.</p>

<p>These cylinders are perforated and were worn suspended
from the neck or wrist, as is most frequently the
case with talismans, and the engraved designs often represent
religious or mythological subjects, the accompanying
inscription merely consisting of the names of the
gods. Cylinders of this type could not have been used as
personal signets, and it is quite possible that Dr. Wiedemann
is right in supposing that their imprint on a document
was considered to impart a certain mystic sanction
to the agreement, and render the divinities or spirits
accountable for the fulfilment of the contract.<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>The oldest known form of seal is the cylinder. Babylonian
and Assyrian cylinder-seals are known of a date
as early as 4000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> From the earliest period until 2500
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> they were made of black or green serpentine, conglomerate,
diorite, and frequently of the central core of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
a large conch shell from the Persian Gulf. From 2500
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to 500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the cylindrical form was prevalent, and the
materials include a brick-red ferruginous quartz, red
hematite (an iron ore), and chalcedony, a beautiful
variety of the last-named stone known as sapphirine being
sometimes used. On the cylinders produced from 4000
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to 2500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the designs most frequently represent
animal forms; on those dating from 2500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to 500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
are generally inscribed five or six rows of cuneiform
characters. Up to the last-named date the work was all
done by the sapphire point, and not by the wheel, and it
is not until the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> that wheel work is
apparent in any Babylonian or Assyrian stone-engraving.
In the course of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the cylindrical seals
became less frequent, and the tall cone-like seals came
into use.<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>A new type makes its appearance about the fifth or
sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, namely, the scaraboid seal introduced
from Egypt. From the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> until the second
or third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, the seals became lower and flatter,
and the perforation larger, until they sometimes assumed
the form of rings; later the ring form becomes general.
They are usually hollowed a little in the middle, which
gives them the shape and size of the lower short joints
of a reed; indeed, it has been suggested that the original
seal was rudely patterned after a reed joint. The materials
used for these cylinders include lapis-lazuli, very
freely used and probably from the Persian mines, jasper,
rock-crystals, chalcedony, carnelian, agate, jade, etc.; a
hard, black variety of serpentine is perhaps the most
common of all the materials used for this purpose.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>A good example of these talismanic cylinders shows
the figure of the god Nebo, seated on a throne and holding
a ring in his left hand. Before him are two altars, over
which appear, respectively, a star and the crescent moon;
in front of the god is the figure of a man in an attitude
of adoration. Borsippa, where the cylinder was found,
was the special seat of the worship of Nebo, whose name
appears in those of the kings Nebuchadnezzar, Nebopalasser,
and Nabonaid. Regarded as the inventor of
writing and as the god of learning, Nebo was the lord of
the planet Mercury, and this shows a close connection
between Babylonian and Græco-Roman ideas in reference
to the god associated with that planet. Nebo was
also believed to be the orderer of times and seasons, and
this character is indicated by the star and the crescent.<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>The Cretan peasants of to-day set a high value upon
certain very ancient seals—dating perhaps from as early
as 2500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>—which they find buried in the soil. These
seals are inscribed with symbols supposed to represent
the prehistoric Cretan form of writing. Of course these
inscriptions, which have not yet been deciphered by archæologists,
are utterly incomprehensible for the peasants,
but they undoubtedly serve to render the stones objects
of mystery. The peasants call them <i>galopetræ</i>, or “milk-stones,”
and they are supposed to promote the secretion
of milk, as was the case with the galactite.<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> The careful
preservation of these so-called <i>galopetræ</i> by Cretan

as otherwise so large a supply of these very interesting
seals would not now be available.</p>

<p>Many engraved stones of the Roman imperial period
bore the figures of Serapis and of Isis, the former signifying
Time and the latter Earth. On other stones the
symbols of the zodiacal signs appear, referring to the
natal constellation of the wearer. The astrologers, who
derived their lore from the Orient, were consulted by all
classes of the Roman people, and it is therefore very
natural that the signet, or the ring worn as an amulet,
should frequently have been engraved with astrological
symbols. These designs were usually engraved on onyxes,
carnelians, and similar stones, in Greek and Roman
times; but occasionally the emerald was used in this way,
and more rarely the ruby or the sapphire. Here the
costliness of the material was probably thought to en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>hance
the value of the amulet. The emerald ring of
Polycrates must have possessed some other than a purely
artistic value in his eyes, when it could be regarded by
him as the most precious of his possessions.</p>

<p>In Roman times the image of Alexander the Great
was looked upon as possessing magic virtues, and it is
related that when Cornelius Macer gave a splendid banquet
in the temple of Hercules, the chief ornament of the
table was an amber cup, in the midst of which was a portrait
of Alexander, and around this his whole history
figured in small, finely engraved representations. From
this cup Macer drank to the health of the pontifex and
then ordered that it should be passed around among the
guests, so that each one might gaze upon the image of the
great man. Pollio, relating this, states that it was a
common belief that everything happened fortunately for
those who bore with them Alexander’s portrait executed
in gold or silver.<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> Indeed, even among Christians coins
of Alexander were in great favor as amulets, and the
stern John Chrysostom sharply rebukes those who wore
bronze coins of this monarch attached to their heads and
their feet.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>Nowhere in the world was the use of amulets so common
as in Alexandria, especially in the first centuries
of our era, and the types produced here were scattered
far and wide throughout the Roman world. Amulets
made from various colored stones had been used for
religious purposes in Egypt from the very earliest period
of its history, so that the custom was deeply rooted in
that land. When, therefore, Alexandria was founded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and became a great commercial
centre, attracting men of all races and all religions, it is
not surprising that the population eagerly adopted the
various amulets used by the adherents of the different
religions. The result was a combining and confusion
of many different types. With the rapid rise and growth
of the Christian religion, a new element was introduced.
Unquestionably the leading Christian teachers were
strongly opposed to such superstitious practices, but the
rank and file of the faithful clung to their old fancies.</p>

<p>In the second century the Gnostic heresy gave a new
impulse to the fabrication of amulets. This strange
eclecticism, resulting from an interweaving of pagan and
Christian ideas, with its complicated symbolism, much of
which is almost incomprehensible, found expression in
the creation of the most bizarre types of amulets, and the
magic virtues of the curious designs was enhanced by
inscriptions purposely obscure. The incomprehensible
always seems to have a mysterious charm for those
devoted to the magic arts, and the adepts willingly
catered to this taste, so that we can often only guess at
the signification of the words and names engraved upon
the Gnostic or Basilidian gems. So widespread was their
use throughout the Roman Empire, that there were factories
entirely devoted to the production of these
objects.<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>Regarding the sacred name Abrasax, which was inscribed
on so many Gnostic gems, we read in St. Augustine’s
treatise De hæres., vi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> “Basilides asserted that
there were 365 heavens; it was for this reason that he
regarded the name Abrasax as sacred and venerable.”</p>

<p>It is, however, not unlikely that the 365 days in the
solar year are signified; and this enigmatical name might
thus be brought into connection with Mithra, the solar
divinity, who was worshipped throughout the Persian
and Roman empires in the first and second centuries of
our era.</p>

<p>A very recondite but ingenious explanation of the
Gnostic name Abrasax is given by Harduin in his notes
to Pliny’s “Natural History.”<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> He sees in the first
three letters the initials of the three Hebrew words signifying
father, son, and spirit (<i>ab</i>, <i>ben</i>, <i>ruah</i>), the Triune
God; the last four letters are the initials of the
Greek words ἀνθρώπους σώζει ἁγίῳ ξύλῳ or “he saves men by
the sacred wood” (the cross). This seems rather far-fetched,
it must be confessed, and yet to any one familiar
with the vagaries of Alexandrine eclecticism, and with the
tendency of the time and place to make strange and uncouth
combinations of Greek and Hebrew forms, there is
nothing inherently improbable in the explanation. Indeed,
the Hebrew and Greek words in this composite sen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>tence
might have been regarded as typifying the union
of the Old and New Testaments, and such an acrostic
would certainly have been looked upon as possessing a
mystic and supernatural power.</p>

</div>

<p>Many explanations have been offered as to the origin
and significance of the characteristic figure of the
Abrasax god engraved on a number of Gnostic amulets.
There seems to be no doubt that this figure was invented
by Basilides, chief of the Gnostic sect bearing his name,
and who flourished in the early part of the second century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> While the details of the type as perfected were
undoubtedly borrowed from the eclectic symbolism of the
Egyptian and western Asiatic world it is almost impossible
to conjecture the reasons determining the selection
of this particular form.</p>

<p>A jasper engraved with the famous Gnostic symbol
was set in the ring worn by Seffrid, Bishop of Chichester
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1159). This ring was found on the skeleton of the
bishop and is now preserved in the treasury of the Cathedral
of Chichester. Undoubtedly the curious symbolic
figure was given a perfectly orthodox meaning, and, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>deed,
it was not really a pagan symbol, as the Gnostics
were “indifferent Christians,” although their system was
a fanciful elaboration of the doctrines of the late Alexandrian
school of Greek Philosophy and an adaptation of
this to the teachings of Christian tradition. In many
cases, however, gems with purely pagan designs were
worn by Christians, designs such as Isis with the child
Horus, which was taken to be the Virgin Mary with the
infant Jesus.</p>

<p>A curious amulet, apparently belonging to the Gnostic
variety, and intended to bring success to the owner of a
racehorse, is now in the collection of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, in New York. The material is green
jasper with red spots. On the obverse the horse is figured
with the victor’s palm and the name Tiberis; on the reverse
appears the vulture-headed figure of the Abraxas
god and the characters, “<span class="smcap lowercase">ZACTA IAW BAPIA</span>,” which have
been translated, “Iao the Destroyer and Creator.”<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
Possibly this amulet may have been attached to the horse
during his races to insure victory, as we know that amulets
of this kind were used in this way.</p>

<p>As illustrating the eclectic character of some of the
amulets used in the early Christian centuries, we may
note one in the Cabinet de Médailles, in Paris. This has
upon the obverse the head of Alexander the Great; on
the reverse is a she-ass with her foal, and below this a
scorpion and the name Jesus Christ. Another amulet of
this class, figured by Vettori,<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> also has the head of Alex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>ander
on the obverse, while the reverse bears the Greek
monogram of the name Christos.</p>

<p>After the third or fourth century of our era the art
of gem-engraving seems to have been lost, or at least
to have been very seldom practised, and it is noteworthy
in the matter that after this period writers who treat
of the virtues of engraved gems as talismans rarely, if
ever, use the words “if you engrave” such or such a
figure on a stone, but write “if you find” such a figure.</p>

<p>The figures engraved on precious stones were supposed
to have a greater or lesser degree of efficacy in
themselves independent of the virtues peculiar to the
stone on which they were engraved, and this efficacy depended
largely upon the hour, day, or month during which
the work was executed. For the influence of the planet,
star, or constellation which was in the ascendant was
thought to infuse a subtle essence into the stone while
the appropriate image was being engraved. However,
to exert the maximum power, the virtue of the image
must be of the same character as the virtue inherent in
the material, and the gem became less potent when this
was not the case. Certain images, those symbolizing the
zodiacal signs for instance, were looked upon as possessing
such power that their peculiar nature impressed itself
even upon stones inherently of different quality;
others again were only efficacious when engraved on
stones the quality of which was in sympathy with them.<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>Naturally, many of the ancient gems which had been
preserved from Greek and Roman times were recognized
as being purely products of art, but in medieval and later
times the idea of the magic quality of all engraved gems
had become so deeply rooted that in many cases a magical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
character was ascribed to them entirely foreign to the
intention of the engraver. Great ingenuity was often
displayed in seeking and finding some analogy between
the supposed significance of the design and the fancied
power of the stone itself. Taking the agate as an illustration,
Camillo Leonardo says that its many different
varieties had as many different virtues, and he finds in
this an explanation of the multiplicity of images engraved
on the various kinds of agate, without realizing that the
true reason was that this material lent itself more
readily to artistic treatment than did many others.</p>

<p>The idea that some special design should be engraved
upon a given stone became quite general in the early centuries
of our era. The emerald, for instance, according
to Damigeron, was to be engraved with a scarab, beneath
which was to be a standing figure of Isis. The gem, when
completed, was to be pierced longitudinally and worn in
a brooch. The fortunate owner of this talisman was then
to adorn himself and the members of his family, and, a
consecration having been pronounced, he was assured
that he would see “the glory of the stone granted it by
God.”<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Possibly this may have meant that the stone
would become luminous.</p>

<p>A list of these symbolic designs is said to have been
given in the “Book of Wings,” by Ragiel, one of the
curious treatises composed about the thirteenth century
under the influence of Hebrew and Greco-Roman tradition.
Although it owes its origin to the Hebrew “Book of
Raziel,” it bears little if any likeness to that work. As
will be seen in the following items, the fact that the design
is on its appropriate stone is always insisted on:</p>

<p>When thou findest a stone on which is graven the figure of a man

<p>Hold dear that stone on which thou shalt find figured or cut the

guards him from lust.</p>

<p>A jewel to be prized is that stone on which is graven or figured a

the ill-effects of the heat.<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The original meaning of the swastika emblem has
been variously explained as a symbol of fire, of the four
cardinal points, of water, of the lightning, etc. Still
another explanation is given by Hoernes, who inclines to
the belief that it is simply a conventionalized representation
of the human form, the lower shaft being the two
legs joined together, the two horizontal shafts the outstretched
arms, and the upper shaft the trunk of the
body; the four projections would stand for the feet, the
two hands and the head.<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>The Egyptian crux ansata, the hieroglyphic symbol
for “life,” and the Phœnician Tau symbol, the “mark”
that was to be stamped upon the foreheads of the faithful
in Jerusalem (Ezek. ix, 4), and which in Early Christian
art was frequently substituted for the usual cross, are
both explained by Hoernes in a similar way, and he notes
the fact that the swastika symbol does not appear in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Egyptian or Phœnician art, drawing the inference that
all three symbols originated in the same form or figure.<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
To all these symbols were attributed talismanic virtues

<p>The so-called “Monogrammatic Cross” was very
freely used in work of the fifth century. This is simply
a modification of the monogram formed of the first two
letters of the name Christ as written in Greek, a device
which first appeared after the time of Constantine the
Great (d. 337 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>). This monogram usually assumed the
following form: ☧, and the “Monogrammatic Cross”
was made by changing the position of the Greek X (chi),
and making one of its arms serve as the straight stroke
of the P (r), thus giving the following form: ⳨.</p>

<p>A curious amulet to avert the spell of the Evil Eye
is an engraved sard showing an eye in the centre, around
which are grouped the attributes of the divinities presiding
over the days of the week. Sunday, the dies Solis,
is represented by a lion; Monday, the dies Lunæ, by a
stag; Tuesday, the dies Martis, by a scorpion; Wednesday,
the dies Mercurii, by a dog; Thursday, the dies Jovis,
by a thunderbolt; Friday, the dies Veneris, by a snake;
and Saturday, the dies Saturni, by an owl.<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> In this way
the wearer was protected at all times from the evil influence.</p>

<p>Because of its peculiar markings, some of which suggest
the form of an eye, malachite was worn in some parts
of Italy (<i>e.g.</i>, in Bettona) as an amulet to protect the
wearer from the spell of the Evil Eye. Such stones were
called “peacock-stones,” from their resemblance in color
and marking to the peacock’s tail. The form of these
malachite amulets is usually triangular, and they were
mounted in silver. It is curious to note, as a proof of the
persistence of superstitions, that in an Etruscan tomb
at Chiusi there was found a triangular, perforated piece
of glass, each angle terminating in an eye formed of glass
of various colors.<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>On many of the amulets fabricated in Italy for protection
against the dreaded jettatura, or spell of the
Evil Eye, the cock is figured. His image was supposed in
ancient times to assure the protection of the sun-god, and
his crowing was regarded as an inarticulate hymn of
praise to this deity. He was also a type of dauntless
courage. All this contributed to make him a defender of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the weak, especially of women and children, against the
wiles of the spirits of darkness.<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Rostand, in his
“Chantecler,” has enlarged this conception, and endows
the cock with the proud conviction that it is to his matutinal
chant alone that the world owes the daily recurrent
phenomenon of the sunrise.</p>

<p>In Palestine the Evil Eye is supposed to be the baleful
gift of men who have light-blue eyes, more especially if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
they are beardless. Possibly this is the power in which
some of our blond and beardless “mashers” repose their
trust. As an antidote to the awful influence of these
blue-eyed monsters, the Syrian women decorated themselves
with blue beads, on the principle <i lang="la">similia similibus
curantur</i>. A maiden with beautiful hair will tie a blue
ribbon about it, or wear a blue bead in it, so as to ward
off any evil spell cast by the blue eye that might rob her
of her fair dower.<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that many amulets were made
in forms suggesting objects offensive to our sense of
propriety. These were thought to protect the wearers
by denoting the contempt they felt for the evil spirits
leagued against them. Some such fancy may have induced
the peculiar designs of certain of the jewels alleged
to have been pawned in Paris by the ex-Sultan Abdul
Hamid for the sum of 1,200,000 francs ($240,000). According
to rumor, these pledges must be sold, as the
sultan has failed to redeem them, but the designs are so
<i>risqué</i> that they cannot be offered at public sale; therefore
the stones and pearls are to be removed and the gold
settings are to be melted and sold as metal.</p>

<p>It is not exclusively characteristic of our commercial
and industrial age that the price paid for a work of art
should influence the popular estimation of the merits of
the work, as appears in an anecdote related by Pliny.
An emerald (smaragd), upon which was engraved a
figure of Amymone (one of the Danaidæ), having been
offered for sale in the Isle of Cyprus, at the price of six
golden denarii, Ismenias, a flute-player, gave orders to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
purchase it. The dealer, however, reduced the price and
returned two denarii; upon which Ismenias remarked,
“By Hercules! he has done me but a bad turn in this, for
the merit of the stone has been greatly impaired by this
reduction in price.”<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>A variant of the design directed by Damigeron to be
placed on the emerald is recommended in a thirteenth
century manuscript, where we read that to fit this stone
for use as a talisman, it should be engraved with the
form of a scarab, beneath which there should appear a
crested paroquet.<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> According to the same manuscript,
a jasper should bear the figure of Mars fully armed, or
else that of a virgin wearing a flowing robe and bearing
a laurel branch. It should then be “consecrated with perpetual
consecration.” The mythical author Cethel asserts
that the owner of a jasper engraved with the sacred
symbol of the cross would be preserved from drowning.<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>A curious quid pro quo appears in a fifteenth century
treatise on gems written in French. Here, in a list of
engraved gems suitable for use as amulets, we read, “If
you find a dromedary engraved on a stone with hair flowing
over its shoulders, this stone will bring peace and
concord between man and wife.” The original Latin text
read, “If you find Andromeda on a stone with hair flowing
over her shoulders,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> The translator’s art which
could turn Andromeda into a dromedary almost equalled
that of the enchantress Circe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>A few even of the early writers were disposed to be
sceptical as to the virtues ascribed to these engraved
gems, and did not hesitate to assert that the Greek and
Roman engravers executed their designs for ornamental
purposes rather than to fit the gems for use as talismans.
This was undoubtedly true in a large number of cases
but nevertheless, as we have seen, many engraved talismans
were really cut in the early centuries. As the art
of gem engraving was not practised in the Middle Ages,
some medieval writers suppose that the engraved talismanic
gems current in their time were not works of art,
but of nature, and Konrad von Megenberg accepting this
view, gave it as his opinion that “God granted these
stones their beauty and virtue for the help and comfort
of the human race,” adding that when he hoped to receive
help from them he in no wise denied the grace of
God.<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>Damigeron writes of the sard that, if worn by a
woman, it is a good and fortunate stone. It should be engraved
with a design showing a grape-vine and ivy intertwined.<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>A celebrated topaz was that noted by George Agricola
as being in the possession of a Neapolitan, Hadrianus
Gulielmus.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> It bore, in ancient Roman characters, the
terse and pregnant inscription:</p>

<p>There is in the Imperial Academy at Moscow a turquoise
two inches in diameter, inscribed with a text from
the Koran in letters of gold. This turquoise was formerly
worn by the Shah of Persia as an amulet, and it
was valued at 5000 rubles by the jeweller from whose
hands it came.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>It is well known that Napoleon III was inclined to be
superstitious, and there is not, therefore, anything inherently
improbable in the report that he left the seal he
wore on his watch-chain to his son, the unfortunate Prince
Imperial, as a talisman. This seal is said to have borne
an inscription in Arabic characters, signifying “The
slave Abraham relying on the Merciful One (God).”<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
The talisman lost its virtue on that unlucky day when, in
far-off Zululand, the heir to so many hopes was cut off
in the first flush of early manhood (see page <a href="#Page_64">64</a>).</p>

<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THERE can be little doubt that much of the modern
superstition regarding the supposed unlucky
quality of the opal owes its origin to a careless reading
of Sir Walter Scott’s novel, “Anne of Geierstein.”<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>
The wonderful tale therein related of the Lady Hermione,
a sort of enchanted princess, who came no one knew
whence and always wore a dazzling opal in her hair, contains
nothing to indicate that Scott really meant to represent
the opal as unlucky. Lady Hermione’s gem was
an enchanted stone just as its owner was a product of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
enchantment, and its peculiarities depended entirely upon
its mysterious character, which might equally well have
been attributed to a diamond, a ruby, or a sapphire. The
life of the stone was bound up with the life of Hermione;
it sparkled when she was gay, it shot out red gleams
when she was angry; and when a few drops of holy water
were sprinkled over it, they quenched its radiance. Hermione
fell into a swoon, was carried to her chamber, and
the next day nothing but a small heap of ashes remained
on the bed whereon she had been laid. The spell was
broken and the enchantment dissolved. All that can have
determined the selection of the opal rather than any
other precious stone is the fact of its wonderful play of
color and its sensitiveness to moisture. Hence we are
perfectly justified in returning to the older belief of the
manifold virtues of the opal, only remembering that this
gem is a little more fragile than many others and should
be more carefully handled and guarded.</p>

<p>The opal, October’s gem, recalls in its wonderful and
varied play of color the glories of a bright October day
in the country, when earth and sky vie with each other
in brilliancy and the eye is fairly dazzled with the bewildering
variety of color.</p>

<p>It rarely happens that Pliny gives any information
as to particular jewels, almost all his notices of precious
stones being confined to descriptions of their form and
color, and data regarding what was popularly believed
as to their talismanic or therapeutic power. In the case
of the <i>opalus</i>, however, he writes as follows: “There
exists to-day a gem of this kind, on account of which the
senator Nonius was proscribed by Antony. Seeking
safety in flight, he took with him of all his possessions
this ring alone, which it is certain, was valued at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
2,000,000 sesterces ($80,000).”<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> The stone was “as
large as a hazel-nut.”</p>

<p>This “opal of Nonius” would be the great historic
opal if we had any assurance that it was really the stone
to which we now give this name. As, however, the principal
European source of supply in Hungary does not
appear to have been available in classic times to the
Romans, and as opals are not found in the places whence,
according to Pliny, the <i>opalus</i> was derived, we are almost
forced to the conclusion that he had some other stone in
mind when he gave his eloquent description of the <i>opalus</i>.
And yet, in spite of all this, Pliny’s words so well describe
the beauties of a fine opal that it is difficult to determine
what other stone he could have meant. For it can well
be said of opals that “There is in them a softer fire than
in the carbuncle, there is the brilliant purple of the
amethyst; there is the sea-green of the emerald—all
shining together in incredible union. Some by their refulgent
splendor rival the colors of the painters, others
the flame of burning sulphur or of fire quickened by oil.”<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
Possibly some brilliant varieties of iridescent quartz—“iris”
quartz, possessing an internal fracture, displays
with great brilliancy all the colors of the rainbow, sparkling
with wonderful clearness in its field of transparent
mineral—might excite the admiration of one who had
never seen an opal. Referring again to these quartz
crystals, they are often cut so as to form a dome of
quartz and are even used as distinct jewels. The fact
that Pliny could praise the Indian imitations of the
<i>opalus</i> in glass, and could state that this stone was more
successfully imitated than any other, is an almost de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>cisive
argument against identifying the <i>opalus</i> with an
opal, for it is well known that no stone is more difficult
to imitate.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century, a peasant
found a brilliant precious stone in some old ruins at
Alexandria, Egypt. This stone was set in a ring. It was
as large as a hazel-nut and is said to have been an opal
cut <i lang="fr">en cabochon</i>. According to the report, it was eventually
taken to Constantinople, where it was estimated to
be worth “several thousand ducats.”<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> The description
given of this gem, its apparent antiquity, and the high
value set upon it have contributed to induce many to
conjecture that it was the celebrated “opal of Nonius.”
Of course this was nothing but a romantic fancy. It is
also quite certain that an opal would scarcely hold its
play of color or compactness for twenty centuries, for
most opals lose their water—slowly perhaps, but surely—within
a lesser space of time. Even the finest Hungarian
opals show some loss of life and color within a century
or even less, and some transparent Mexican opals lose
their color and are filled with flaws within a few years’
time.</p>

<p>The Edda tells of a sacred stone called the yarkastein,
which the clever smith Volöndr (the Scandinavian Vulcan)
formed from the eyes of children. Grimm conjectures
that this name designates a round, milk-white opal.
Certainly the opal was often called <i>ophthalmios</i>, or eyestone,
in the Middle Ages, and it was a common idea that
the image of a boy or girl could be seen in the pupil of the
eye.</p>

</div>

<p>Albertus Magnus describes under the name <i>orphanus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
a stone which was set in the imperial crown of the Holy
Roman Empire. This gem is believed to have been a
splendid opal, and Albertus describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The orphanus is a stone which is in the crown of the Roman
Emperor, and none like it has ever been seen; for this very reason
it is called orphanus. It is of a subtle vinous tinge, and its hue is as
though pure white snow flashed and sparkled with the color of bright,
ruddy wine, and was overcome by this radiance. It is a translucent
stone, and there is a tradition that formerly it shone in the night-time;
but now, in our age, it does not sparkle in the dark. It is said
to guard the regal honor.<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>Evidently this imperial gem was regarded as <i lang="la">sui
generis</i>, for Albertus has just described the <i lang="la">ophthalmus
lapis</i>, a name frequently bestowed upon the opal in medieval
times, reciting the virtues usually ascribed to the opal
for the cure of diseases of the eye, and the magic power
of the stone to render its wearer invisible, wherefore it
was denominated <i lang="la">patronus furum</i>, or “patron of
thieves.”</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the opal mines of Cernowitz, in
Hungary, were very actively exploited, and at the opening
of the fifteenth century more than three hundred men
are said to have been employed here in the search for
opals. At that time, and for many centuries after, no
breath of suspicion ever tarnished the fame of the opal
as not only a thing of rare beauty, but also a talisman of
the first rank. We are told that blond maidens valued
nothing more highly than necklaces of opals, for while
they wore these ornaments their hair was sure to guard
its beautiful color. The latter superstitions probably
arose from the frangibility of the stone and its occasional
loss of fire.</p>

<p>From the earliest times the baleful influence of the
Evil Eye has struck terror into the souls of the ignorant
and superstitious. It is believed by some that the name
“opal”—written “ophal” in the time of Queen Elizabeth—was
derived from <i>ophthalmos</i>, the eye, or <i>ophthalmius</i>,
pertaining to the eye, and that hence the foolish
superstition regarding the ill luck of the opal had some
connection with the belief in the Evil Eye. However,
this is altogether incorrect, since the stone called <i>ophthalmius</i>
by early writers, and which seems to have been the
opalus of the ancients and our opal, was believed to have
a wonderfully beneficial effect upon the sight, and if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
was thought to render the wearer invisible, this was only
an added virtue of the stone.</p>

<p>The eye-agates were sometimes used to form the eyes
of idols. At a later period some of these “agate-eyes”
were removed from the statues and cut with a glyptic
subject on the lower side. Some of the most interesting
antique gems are of this kind. In Aleppo (and elsewhere
in the East) there is a certain type of sore known as the
“Aleppo button” or “Aleppo boil.” The boil frequently
does not appear for a long period after infection
has taken place. It often appears as a swelling surrounded
by a white ring, and there is a belief among the
natives that there are “Aleppo stones,” these being the
so-called “eye-agates” frequently produced by cutting
a three-layer, naturally pale yellow or pale gray agate,
with intervening white zones in such a way that it looks
like an eye or a double-eye, and such stones are used in
alleviation of the Aleppo sore. What beneficial influence
they may have is due to the fact that the agate is cold
and furnishes a little relief for the time.</p>

<p>This “Aleppo boil” or “Oriental sore” so prevalent
in many parts of western Asia, is produced, according to
the best authorities, by a pathogenic organism <i>Leishmania
tropica</i> (Wright) 1903. As to the means by which
this organism is introduced into the human subject nothing
very definite is known, but mosquitoes or <i>Phlebotomus</i>
have been suggested as possible transmitting agencies.<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>The eye of some invisible monster, the eye of the
dragon, the eye of the serpent, were all regarded as possessed
of malign power. It is well known that in the East
Indies a peacock’s feather is thought to bring ill-luck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the eye in the feather being the baleful point. Even in
our own time, and among those for whom this primitive
superstition has no terrors, the humorous use of the
idea—as shown, for instance, in the “Dick Dead-Eye” of
Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Pinafore”—proves that the Evil
Eye is familiar to our thoughts. For this reason, stones
such as those which have been named the cat’s-eye, the
tiger’s-eye, or the oculus Beli, always possess a certain
strange interest.</p>

<p>One of the earliest descriptions of the opal in English
is that written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by Dr.
Stephen Batman (d. 1584). While the passage is essentially
a translation from the “De proprietatibus rerum,”
of Bartolomæus Anglicus, the English version is interesting
in itself as showing what was accepted by English
readers of the time regarding the virtues of the opal.
There is, of course, no trace of the foolish modern superstition
touching the ominous quality of this beautiful
gem. Batman writes:<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Optallio is called Oppalus also, and is a stone distinguished with
colors of divers precious stones, as <i>Isid.</i> saith.... This stone
breedeth onely in <i>Inde</i> and is deemed to have as many virtues, as
hiewes and colours. Of this <i>Optallius</i> it is said in Lapidario, that this
<i>Optallius</i> keepeth and saveth his eyen that beareth it, cleere and sharp
and without griefe, and dimmeth other men’s eyen that be about, with
a maner clowde, and smiteth them with a maner blindnesse, that is
called <i>Amentia</i>, so that they may not see neither take heede what is
done before their eyen. Therefore it is said that it is the most sure
patron of theeves.</p></blockquote>

<p>The opal seems to have appealed to Shakespeare as a
fit emblem of inconstancy, for in “Twelfth Night” he
makes the clown say to the Duke:<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now the melancholy God protect thee, and the Tailor make thy
garment of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is very opal.</p></blockquote>

<p>That the beauty of the opal was fully appreciated
in the sixteenth century is shown by the words of Cardano,
who states that he once bought one of these stones
for fifteen gold crowns and found as much pleasure in its
possession as he did in that of a diamond that had cost
him five hundred crowns.<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> Although superstitious
beliefs were rather the rule than the exception in Cardano’s
time, none of the silly fancies regarding the ominous
quality of the opal were then current. It was
reserved for the nineteenth century to develop these altogether
unreasonable—and indeed almost inexplicable—superstitions.
The ownership of so fair an object as a
fine opal must certainly be a source of pleasure, and hence
add to the good fortune of the owner.</p>

<p>Although opal has been considered by some a stone of
misfortune, black opal is regarded as an exceptionally
lucky stone. Formerly black opals were artificially made
by dipping the light-colored stone into ink, or by allowing
burnt oil to enter cracks in the stone produced by heating.
About the year 1900, however, a number of deposits
of natural black opals were found in the White Cliff
region of New South Wales, whence exceedingly beautiful
gems have been secured, with wonderful flames of green,
red, and blue in a black field. Some of these have sold for
$1000 and even for a higher price, the smaller ones bringing
from a few dollars upward each. It has been claimed
that $2,000,000 worth have been sold from New South
Wales. A remarkable example is figured on the frontispiece
of this volume. The late F. Marion Crawford was a
great admirer of this strangely beautiful variety of opal.</p>

<p>That ill-luck and good-luck are relative terms is shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
us published of an opal by Paris newspapers. A shopgirl,
plainly clad, in crossing the Place de l’Opéra, when
the street traffic was at its greatest, stopped at one of the
“refuges” halfway across the street. To the girl’s great
surprise, an elegantly attired lady standing there slipped
an opal ring from her finger and gave it to the girl, who
took it to a jeweller’s shop to sell it. Here she was
arrested on suspicion of having stolen it. The magistrate
before whom she appeared was inclined to believe
her story and ordered a “personal” in a widely read
journal asking the lady to clear the girl of the charge.
A titled lady presented herself, substantiating the girl’s
statement. She feared ill-luck would befall her if she
wore or kept the ring, which was returned to the shopgirl.</p>

<p>A possible explanation of the superstitious dread the
opal used to excite some time ago may be found in the
fact that lapidaries and gem-setters to whom opals were
entrusted were sometimes so unfortunate as to fracture
them in the process of cutting or setting. This was frequently
due to no fault on the part of the cutters or setters,
but was owing to the natural brittleness of the opal.
As such workmen are responsible to the owners for any
injury to the gems, they would soon acquire a prejudice
against opals, and would come to regard them as unlucky
stones. Very widespread superstitions have no
better foundation than this, for the original cause, sometimes
a quite rational one, is soon lost sight of and popular
fantasy suggests something entirely different and
better calculated to appeal to the imagination.</p>

<p>The belief that the diamond fractured the teeth if it
were put in the mouth, and ruptured the intestines if it
were swallowed, already appears in pseudo-Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
and can therefore be dated back to the ninth and perhaps
to the seventh century. This fancy evidently owes its
origin to the fact that the diamond, because of its hardness,
was used to cut all other stones, and the idea of its
destructive quality was strengthened by the old legends
regarding the venomous serpents which guarded the place
where it was found. Hence the firm conviction that it
would bring death to any one who swallowed it.</p>

<p>According to Garcias ab Orta (1563), the diamond was
not used for medicinal purposes in the India of his time,
except when injected into the bladder to break up vesical
calculi. He notes, however, the prevalent belief that diamonds,
or diamond dust, when taken internally, worked
as a poison. As a proof of the falsity of this belief,
Garcias adduces the fact that the slaves who worked in
the diamond mines often swallowed diamonds to conceal
them, and never experienced any ill effects, the stones
being recovered in a natural way. The same author notes
the case of a man who suffered from chronic dysentery
and whose wife had for a long time administered to him
doses of diamond dust. If this did not help him, neither
did it injure him; finally, by the advice of the doctors,
this strange treatment was abandoned. The man eventually
died of his disease, but many days after the doses
of diamond dust had been discontinued.<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>The Hindus believed that a flawed diamond, or one containing
specks or spots, was so unlucky that it could even
deprive Indra of his highest heaven. The original shape
of the stone was also considered of great importance,
more especially in early times, when but few, if any, diamonds,
were cut. A triangular stone was said to cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
quarrels, a square diamond inspired the wearer with
vague terrors; a five-cornered stone had the worst effect
of all, for it brought death; only the six-cornered diamond
was productive of good.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>The Turkish sultan Bejazet II (1447-1512) is said to
have been done to death by a dose of pulverized diamond
administered to him by his son Selim, who mixed the diamond
dust with the sultan’s food.<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> It is also related that
the disciples of Paracelsus (1493-1541) spread the report
that he died from the effects of a dose of diamond
dust. Ambrosius<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> conjectures that this was only an
excuse to explain the demise of the master in the prime
of life—he was but forty-eight years old at the time of
his death—although he had promised long life to all who
made use of his medicaments.</p>

<p>While Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1571), the unrivalled
goldsmith, was imprisoned in Rome, in 1538, he strongly
suspected that his enemies were seeking to poison him
by tampering with his food. Cellini shared the belief
of his contemporaries that there was no more deadly
poison than diamond dust. One day, while eating his
noonday meal, he felt something grate between his teeth.
He paid no particular attention to this, but when he had
finished eating his eye was caught by some bright particles
on the plate. Picking up one of these and examining
it carefully, he was terrified to find what he supposed
to be a diamond splinter, and he straightway gave himself
up for lost, thinking that he had swallowed a quantity of
diamond dust. He prayed to God for an hour and finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
became reconciled to the thought of dying, but suddenly
it occurred to him that he had not tested the hardness of
the fragment he had found in his food. He immediately
took the splinter and tried to crush it between his knife
and the stone window-sill; to his joy the attempt succeeded,
and he became convinced that what he had swallowed
was not diamond dust. Later, after his release,
Cellini learned that an enemy had given a diamond to a
certain Lione Aretino, a gem-cutter, instructing him to
grind it up so that the dust could be placed in Cellini’s
food. The gem-cutter was very poor and the diamond
was worth a hundred scudi, so the man yielded to temptation
and substituted a citrine for the diamond. To this
circumstance alone did Cellini attribute his escape from
death.<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>In England, more than seventy years after Cellini’s
experience, diamond dust was selected as a poison to do
away with a luckless prisoner. Sir Thomas Overbury
had incurred the bitter animosity of the Countess of
Essex, because he opposed her marriage with the favorite
of James I, Robert Carr, Viscount Somerset, whom he
had befriended and whose career he had furthered. The
marriage took place, however, and, in 1613, Overbury was
imprisoned in the Tower, through the machinations of
the countess. She then sought the aid of one James
Franklin, an apothecary, directing him to concoct a slow
and deadly poison, which should be mixed with Overbury’s
food. In the minutes of Franklin’s confession, he
is said to have stated that the countess asked him what
he thought of white arsenic. His reply was that this
poison would prove too violent. “What say you (quoth
she) to powder of diamonds?” He answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> “I know
not the nature of that.” She said that he was a fool,
and gave him pieces of gold, and bade him buy some of
that powder for her. It appears, however, from the testimony,
that a number of ingredients were employed,
quite probably small doses of mercury, cantharides, etc.,
as well as the baleful diamond dust. Poor Overbury
lingered on for more than three months, but was finally
put out of his misery by a clyster of corrosive sublimate.<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>As a proof of the deadly effects caused by the diamond,
the Portuguese Zacutus relates the case of a merchant’s
servant who surreptitiously swallowed three
rough diamonds belonging to his master. On the following
day this man was seized with violent abdominal pains,
all the remedies administered to him were without effect,
and he soon died from the extensive internal ulceration
produced by the sharp edges of the diamonds.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>This old fancy that diamonds or diamond dust had
deadly effects when swallowed is pretty well exploded by
this time, little or no confirmation being afforded by the
instances cited in the matter. However, quite recently it
has been shown that swallowing a diamond can prove
fatal to a fowl. While a prize-winning cockerel was
being fondled by his proud owner, it spied a flashing
diamond set in a ring on his hand, and immediately pecked
out the stone and swallowed it. Not long after, the fowl
died—not, however, because it was poisoned by the diamond,
but because it was chloroformed to insure the
speedy recovery of the stone.</p>

<p>An old English ballad, treating of the loves of Hind
Horn and Maid Rimnild, recounts that when Hind Horn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
who loved and was beloved by the king’s daughter, went
to sea to escape the wrath of the king, the princess gave
him a ring set with seven diamonds. We are told that
when far from home:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One day he looked his ring upon</div>
<div class="verse">He saw the diamond pale and wan.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hereupon, he hastened back, for the paleness of the
stone was a sign the loved one was unfaithful to him.
On his return, he succeeded in preventing her marriage
to another, and everything ended happily.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>In a fourteenth century MS. of the Old English romance
upon which the ballad is founded, the stone in the
ring is not named; in giving it Rimnild says:<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>In this older form of the tale, the stone either grows
pale or red as a sign of misfortune. It is interesting to
note that Epiphanius, writing a thousand years earlier,
states that the <i>adamas</i> of the high-priest grew red as a
presage of bloodshed and defeat for the Jews.</p>

<p>Regarding the old fancy that a serpent could not look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
upon an emerald without losing its sight, the Arabian gem
dealer, Ahmed Teifashi, in 1242 writes as follows:<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>After having read in learned books of this peculiarity of the
emerald, I tested it by my own experiment and found the statements
exact. It chanced that I had in my possession a fine emerald of the
zabâbi variety, and with this I decided to make the experiment on the
eyes of a viper. Therefore, having made a bargain with a snake-charmer
to procure me some vipers, as soon as I received them I
selected one and placed it in a vessel. This being done, I took a stick
of wood, attached to the end a piece of wax, and embedded my
emerald in this. I then brought the emerald near to the viper’s eyes.
The reptile was strong and vigorous, and even raised its head out
of the vessel, but as soon as I approached the emerald to its eyes, I
heard a slight crepitation and saw that the eyes were protruding and
dissolving into a humor. After this the viper was dazed and confused;
I had expected that it would spring from the vessel, but it
moved uneasily hither and thither, without knowing which way to
turn; all its agility was lost, and its restless movements soon ceased.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wolfgang Gabelchover, in his commentary on the
sixth book of the treatise “De Gemmis,” by Andrea
Baccio, gives the following account of a strange and
tragic experience in regard to a ruby:<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is worthy of note that the true Oriental ruby, by frequent
changes of color and by growing obscurity, announces to the wearer
some impending misfortune or calamity; and the obscurity and
opacity is greater or less according to the extent of the coming ill-fortune.
Alas! that what I had often heard proclaimed by learned
men, I should myself experience; for as, on the fifth of December, 1600,
I was travelling from Stuttgart to Calw with my beloved wife Catherine
Adelmann of pious memory, I plainly observed in the course
of the journey that a very beautiful ruby which she had given me,
and which I wore on my hand, set in a gold ring, once and again lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
its splendid coloring and became obscure, changing its brightness for
a dark hue. This dark hue continued not for one or two days only,
but so long that I was greatly terrified, and, removing the ring from
my finger, concealed it in a case. Wherefore, I repeatedly warned my
wife that some great calamity was impending either for her or for
myself, the which I inferred from the change and variation of the
ruby. Nor was I deceived, for within a few days she was seized with
a dangerous illness, which resulted in her death.</p></blockquote>

<p>A story explaining one at least of these supposedly
ominous changes of color in precious stones, is given by
Johann Jacob Spener, who states that it was told him
by a trustworthy informant:<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was a jeweller, expert, prudent, and rich, three essential
qualities in a jeweller. One day, after having washed his hands, this
man sat at a table, when, glancing at a ruby ring he wore on his
finger, he remarked that the stone, which usually delighted the eye
with its splendor, had lost its brilliancy and become dull. Since he
believed what others had related to him, he was firmly persuaded that
some misfortune threatened him, and, having removed the ring from
his finger, he placed it in its case. A fortnight later, one of this man’s
sons died of varioloid. Reminded by this event of the phenomenon
observed in the ruby, the jeweller took it from the case and found,
on examination, that it had regained its pristine brilliancy. This fact
confirmed him in his belief in the ominous quality of the stone. Once
more, shortly after washing his hands, he remarked anew that the
splendor of the ruby was dimmed, and he again fell a prey to anxiety,
lest some fresh misfortune was impending. Since, however, his apprehensions
proved vain and no untoward event happened, he investigated
the matter carefully, and discovered that the obscuration of
the color was due to a drop of water which had penetrated between
the ruby and the foil, as the jewellers call it, and that the former
brilliancy returned when the water had evaporated.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ominous character of the onyx is especially noted
in Arabic tradition, as is shown by the Arabic name for
the stone, <i>el jaza</i>, “sadness.” The following passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
from pseudo-Aristotle offers an illustration of the
strength of this prejudice against the onyx, which was
said to come from China and the Magreb:<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those who are in the land of China fear this stone so much that
they dread to go into the mines where it occurs; hence none but slaves
and menials, who have no other means of gaining a livelihood, take
the stone from the mines. When it has been extracted, it is carried
out of the country and sold in other lands. Those men of the Magreb
also who are gifted with any wisdom will not wear an onyx or place
it in their treasuries. Indeed, no one is willing to wear it, unless he be
bereft of his senses; for whosoever wears it, either set in a ring or in
any other way, will have fearful dreams and be tormented by a multitude
of doubts and apprehensions; he will also have many disputes
and lawsuits. Lastly, whoever keeps an onyx in his house, or places
it in a vessel, or puts it in food or drink, will suffer loss of energy and
capacity.</p></blockquote>

<p>An ominous character was attributed to the red coral,
especially the more highly colored varieties. If worn so
that the substance came in direct contact with the skin,
it was asserted that the color would pale, the coral also
losing its brightness if the wearer became ill, or even if
he were only threatened with severe illness. The same
effect was said to be induced if some deadly poison had
been taken. Cardano writes that he more than once
observed this phenomenon, and he thinks that in these
cases, where the wearer was not yet attacked by disease,
its threatening “vapor,” though not strong enough to
provoke decided symptoms in the human body, was sufficiently
powerful to offset the more delicate and subtle
essence of the mineral substance. Of course, for us the
mineral would be much less sensitive than flesh and blood,
but the sixteenth century writers, and to a still greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
degree those of an earlier time, attributed to stones not
only life in a general way, but old age, disease, and death,
in a very positive sense.<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>Rabbinical tradition tells of a wonderful luminous
stone placed by Noah in the Ark. This stone shone more
brilliantly by day than by night, and served to distinguish
the day from the night when, during the flood, neither
sun nor moon could be seen.<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> According to another
Jewish legend, Abraham is said to have built a city for
the six sons Hagar bore to him. The wall with which
this city was surrounded was so lofty that the light of the
sun was cut off, and to offset this Abraham gave to his
sons enormous precious stones and pearls. These exceeded
the sun in brightness, and will be used in the time
of the Messiah.<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>Ælian relates the following tale of a luminous stone.
A woman of Tarentum, named Heracleis, who was a
pattern of the domestic virtues, lost her husband and
mourned sincerely for him. Her grief made her compassionate,
for when a young stork just learning to fly
lost its strength and fell to the ground before her, Heracleis
picked up the helpless bird and tended it carefully
until its strength returned and it was able to fly away.
A year later, when the woman was outside the house enjoying
the bright warm sunshine, she saw a stork flying
toward her. As the bird passed over her head, it let
fall a precious stone into her lap. Heracleis took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
stone with, her into the house, feeling by an infallible instinct
that the stork which had dropped it was the one she
had cared for in the previous year. During the night she
woke up, and was astonished to see that the room was
lighted up as though by many torches, the radiance proceeding
from the stone bestowed by the stork as a proof
of its gratitude.<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>In German, the stone called <i>Donnerkeil</i> (thunderbolt)
has several synonyms; among these is <i>Storchstein</i>
(“stork-stone”). It is evident that the stone of Heracleis
was identical with the precious and brilliant variety of
<i>cerauniæ</i> mentioned by Pliny, “which drew to themselves
the radiance of the stars.” The flashing and ruddy light
of the ruby suggested an igneous origin, and induced the
belief that rubies were generated by a fire from heaven,—in
other words, by the lightning flash.<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>The analogy between the flame of a lamp or the glow
of a burning coal and the radiance of a ruby, suggested
some of the names given to this stone, or those resembling
it in color, as, for instance, the Greek <i>anthrax</i> and the
Latin <i>carbunculus</i> and <i>lychnis</i>. Probably the fancy that
such stones were luminous in the dark was nothing more
than the logical result of the quasi-identification of them
with fire in some of its manifestations. Still, it is a well-known
fact that some stones possess a high degree of
phosphorescence. This circumstance must have been
observed by chance, and may have had something to do
with the legends of luminous stones, although this peculiarity
is not characteristic of the ruby.</p>

<p>According to Pliny, the lychnis, perhaps a spinel, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
so called <i>a lucernarum accensu</i> (from the lighting, or the
light, of lamps). The author of the poem “Lithica” says
that the diamond (<i>adamas</i>), like the crystal, when placed
on an altar, sent forth a flame without the aid of fire.<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>
If this did not refer to the use of rock-crystal as a burning-glass,
we might see in the passage an indication that
the phosphorescence of the diamond had already been
noted before the second or third century of our era.</p>

<p>From the Lydian river Tmolus a marvellous stone was
taken which was said to change color four times a day.
This surpasses the properties of the “saphire merveilleux”
which changed its hue at night. Only innocent
young girls could find the Lydian stone, and while they
wore it they were defended from outrage.<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Is it possible
that the ancient writer intended to hint at the proverbial
fickleness of woman, when stating that this changeable
stone could only be discovered by one of the fair sex?</p>

<p>The temple of the Syrian goddess Astarte contained
an image of this divinity crowned with a diadem in which
was set a luminous stone. Such was the splendor of the
light emitted by this gem that the whole sanctuary was
lighted up as though with a myriad of lamps. Indeed,
the stone itself bore the name <i>lychnos</i> (“lamp”). In the
daytime this light was fainter, but was still very noticeable,
as a fiery glow.<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>Two fabulous stones are noted by pseudo-Aristotle,
and one of these, the “sleeping-stone,” must have
possessed marvellous soporific power. It was a luminous
stone of a bright ruddy hue, and shone in the darkness
with a bright light. If a small quantity of this stone were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
hung about a person’s neck, he would sleep uninterruptedly
for three days and nights, and, when awakened on
the fourth day, he would still be almost overcome by sleep.
The other stone, of a greenish hue, had the opposite
quality and induced prolonged wakefulness; so long as
it was worn, sleep was banished. Our author gravely
states that “some men who must watch at night suffer
greatly from lack of sleep.” If, however, they wore the
“waking-stone,” they suffered no inconvenience from
their enforced vigils.<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Evidently this stone would be a
precious possession for night-watchmen, and a more
satisfactory guarantee for their employers than “timeclocks”
or other tests of wakefulness.</p>

<p>In his commentary on Marbodus, Alardus of Amsterdam
relates the history of a wonderful luminous stone, a
“chrysolampis,” which, with many other precious stones,
was set in a marvellous golden tablet dedicated to St.
Adelbert, apostle of the Frisians and patron of the town
of Egmund (d. 720-730), by Hildegard, wife of Theodoric,
Count of Holland. The gift was made to the Abbey of
Egmund, where the saint’s body reposed. Alardus tells
us that the “chrysolampis” shone so brightly that when
the monks were called to the chapel in the night-time,
they could read the Hours without any other light. This
wonderful stone was stolen by one of the monks, whom
Alardus terms “the most rapacious creature who ever
went on two legs”; but, fearing to keep so valuable a gem
with him, he cast it into the sea and it was never recovered.<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>Strange tales were told of a luminous “carbuncle”
on the shrine of St. Elizabeth (d. 1231) at Marburg. This
stone was set above the statuette of the Virgin, and it was
said to emit fiery rays at night. However, Creuzer informs
us that it was only a very brilliant rock crystal
of a yellowish-white hue. The shrine was an elaborate
work of art in silver gilt, and was literally covered with
precious stones to the number of 824, besides two large
pearls and a great many smaller ones. All these gems
were stripped from their settings when the shrine was
taken from Marburg to Cassel in 1810.<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>At the Dusseldorf Exhibition of 1891, the writer saw
what was called “The Ring of St. Elizabeth,” purporting
to be set with her miraculously luminous ruby. The
stone in the setting proved, however, to be a large almost
flat carbuncle garnet of no great brilliancy, set in a
narrow rim of gold.</p>

<p>After noting the reports of medieval travellers regarding
the wonderful luminous rubies of the sovereigns
of Pegu and repeating the tale that the night was illumined
by their splendor, Cleandro Arnobio adds that it
did not appear that any such rubies were to be found in
his day. Nevertheless, he had heard from an ecclesiastic
of a certain jewel that shone brightly at night. This
stone, however, was not a ruby, but was of a pale citron
hue, and hence Arnobio inclines to believe that it was
either a topaz or a yellow diamond.<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> This probably
refers to the Marburg “carbuncle.”</p>

<p>The luminous “ruby” of the King of Ceylon is noted
by Chau Ju-Kua,<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> a Chinese writer of about the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of the thirteenth century and hence a contemporary of
the Arab Teifashi. He says: “The king holds in his
hand a jewel five inches in diameter, which cannot be
burned by fire, and which shines in the night like a
torch.” This gigantic luminous gem was also believed
to possess the virtues of an elixir of youth, for we are
told that the king rubbed his face with it daily and by this
means would retain his youthful looks even should he
live more than ninety years.</p>

<p>The glories of Emperor Manuel’s (ca. 1120-1180)
throne are celebrated by the Hebrew traveller Benjamin
of Tudela, who visited Constantinople in 1161 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> This
splendid throne was of gold studded with precious stones
and, suspended from the canopy by gold chains, hung a
magnificent golden crown set with jewels of incalculable
value and so bright and sparkling that their glitter rendered
needless any other illumination at night.<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>When Henry II of France (1519-1559) made his
solemn entry into the city of Boulogne, a stranger from
India presented to the sovereign a luminous stone. It
was rather soft, had a fiery brilliance, and could not be
touched with impunity. According to De Thou, this story
was vouched for by J. Pipin, who saw the stone himself
and described it in a letter to Antoine Mizauld, a writer
on occult themes, well known in his day.<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>Although Garcias ab Orta did not believe in the tales
current in his time regarding luminous rubies, he relates
a story of such a stone told to him by a gem-dealer. This
man stated that he had purchased a number of fine but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
small rubies from Ceylon, and had spread them out over
a table. When he gathered them up again, one of the
stones remained hidden in a fold of the table-cloth. In
the night he remarked something like a flame emanating
from the table. Lighting a candle, he approached the
table and found there the small ruby; when this was
removed and the candle extinguished, the light was no
longer visible. Garcias admits that the gem-dealers were
fond of telling good stories, but he concludes with the
dictum, “we must trust in them nevertheless.”<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>Not only the ruby, but the emerald also had the reputation
of being a luminous stone, for, besides the shining
“emerald” pillar in the temple of Melkart at Tyre, Pliny
records the tale of a marble lion, with eyes of gleaming
emeralds, which was set over the tomb of “a petty king
called Hermias.” This tomb was on the coast, and the
flashing light from the emerald eyes frightened away
the tunny-fish, to the great loss of the fishermen.<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
Whether the eyes of the magnificent chryselephantine
statue of Athene by Phidias were supposed to be luminous
we do not know, but they were incrusted with precious
stones.<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>The collection of works by the English alchemists,
published by Elias Ashmole, contains the tale of a worthy
parson who lived in a little town near London, and who
wished to immortalize himself by building across the
Thames a bridge which would always be lighted at night.
After relating several expedients which suggested themselves
to him, the poet continues:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At the laste he thought to make the light,</div>
<div class="verse">For the Bridge to shine by nighte,</div>
<div class="verse">With <i>Carbuncle Stones</i>, to make men wonder,</div>
<div class="verse">With double reflexion above and under:</div>
<div class="verse">Then new thought troubled his Minde</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Carbuncle Stones</i> how he might finde;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And where to find wise men and trewe,</div>
<div class="verse">Which would for his interest pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">In seeking all the Worlde about,</div>
<div class="verse">Plenty of Carbuncles to find out;</div>
<div class="verse">For this he took so mickle thought,</div>
<div class="verse">That his fatt flesh wasted nigh to naught.<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that the poor parson
never realized his dream, but the story shows how popular
was the belief that carbuncles or rubies shone with
their own light.</p>

<p>A luminous or phosphorescent stone, which has been
named the Bologna stone, is the subject of a treatise published
by the physician Mentzel in 1675.<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> The writer
describes various experiments made to test the peculiar
qualities of this mineral, which is partly a radiated or
crystalline sulphate of barytes, and phosphoresces when
calcined. It was sometimes called the “lunar stone”
(<i>lapis lunaris</i>), because, like the moon, it gave out in the
darkness the light it received from the sun. Mentzel also
relates that the stone was first discovered, in 1604, by
Vincenzio Casscioroli, an adept in alchemy, who believed
that it would be a great aid in the transmutation of the
baser metals into gold, on account of its solar quality.
The place of its occurrence was Monte Paterno, near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Bologna, where it appeared in the fissures of the mountain,
after torrential rains.</p>

<p>The various phenomena of fluorescence and phosphorescence
undoubtedly explain some at least of the legends
regarding luminous stones, superstition or fantasy having
here as in most other cases a certain substratum
of fact. This class of physical phenomena has been made
the subject of special investigation by the author, as
many as 13,000 specimens of various minerals having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
been subjected to the most searching tests in order to
determine their qualities in this respect.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> His interest
in this field of research was greatly stimulated by a
fortuitous happening. In 1891 his wife, while hanging
up a gown in a closet one evening, saw that the diamond
in a ring she was wearing gave off a faint streak of light
which was very noticeable in the dark, and this fact led
to a long series of experiments on the fluorescence, phosphorescence,
and triboluminescence of the diamond.<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>
More than two centuries before, Robert Boyle made a
similar set of experiments at night with a diamond which
must have been an Indian stone, and which he describes
as table cut, about one-third of an inch long and somewhat
less in width; he remarks that it was a dull stone of very
bad water, having a blemish with a whitish cloud covering
nearly a third of the stone.<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>The “Journal des Sçavans” for 1739 gives certain
tests of the luminous quality of diamonds made by Mons.
Du Fay. In order successfully to observe this phenomenon,
he prescribes that the experimenter shall remain in
a darkened room for fifteen minutes, taking the additional
precaution of closing one or both of his eyes. The diamond
to be tested should be exposed to the sun’s rays, or
to strong daylight, for less than a minute, and when taken
into darkness the luminosity, if observable, lasts twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
or thirteen minutes at longest. Not all diamonds show
this quality, and nothing in their form or appearance
serves to determine their possession of it. However,
Mons. du Fay observed that the yellow diamonds, of
which he tried a considerable number, were luminous.
A single emerald, out of twenty that were tested, proved
to be luminous.<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<ul class="small"><li>1. Self-print of upper diamond of No. 4 by phosphorescence, produced by rubbing briskly with
stick covered by woolen cloth. Exposure one-half minute.</li>

<li>2. Self-print, both diamonds, after one minute’s exposure to ultra-violet light, electric action

<li>6. Aspect of both diamonds (No. 4), one minute’s exposure, ultra-violet light; blue-white phosphorescing

</ul>

<p>Boyle’s experiments led to the discovery that some
diamonds, when rubbed against wood or other hard substances,
and even against cloth or silk, will emit a ray of
light which seems to follow them; this is what is called
triboluminescence.</p>

<p>The power of absorbing sunlight or artificial light
and then giving it off in the dark is only possessed by
certain diamonds. These are Brazilian stones, slightly
milky in tint, or blue-white as they are often termed, and
it is an included substance and not the diamond itself
that possesses the power of storing up light and then
giving it out. Willemite, kunzite, sphalerite (sulphide
of zinc) and some other minerals possess the same power.
Their peculiar property may be due to the presence of a
slight quantity of manganese or to that of some of the
uranium salts. That it is only the ultra-violet rays that
are thus absorbed by these diamonds is proved by the
fact that the phenomenon is not observable when a thin
plate of glass is interposed between the sunlight or
artificial light and the diamond, as glass is not traversed
by these rays. The still undetermined substance to
whose presence in diamonds of this type the special class
of phenomena must be due, was named by the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
tiffanyite, in honor of the late Charles L. Tiffany (1812-1902),
founder of the firm of Tiffany &amp; Company.<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>On the other hand all diamonds phosphoresce when
exposed to the rays of radium, polonium, or actinium,
even when glass is interposed. Treating of some of the
aspects of phosphorescence in diamonds, Sir William
Crookes says:<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a vacuum, exposed to a high-tension current of electricity, diamonds
phosphoresce of different colours, most South African diamonds
shining with a bluish light. Diamonds from other localities emit bright
blue, apricot, pale blue, red, yellowish-green, orange, and pale green light.
The most phosphorescent diamonds are those which are fluorescent in the
sun. One beautiful green diamond in my collection, when phosphorescing
in a good vacuum, gives almost as much light as a candle, and you
can easily read by its rays. But the time has hardly come when diamonds
can be used as domestic illuminants!</p>

<p>By permission of Mrs. Kunz, wife of the well-known New York
mineralogist, I will show you perhaps the most remarkable of all
phosphorescing diamonds. This prodigy diamond will phosphoresce in
the dark for some minutes after being exposed to a small pocket
electric light, and if rubbed on a piece of cloth a long streak of
phosphorescence appears.</p></blockquote>

<p>The luminescence produced by heat is wonderfully
marked in the case of chlorophane, a variety of fluorite.
A Siberian specimen of a pale violet color emitted a white
light merely from the heat of the hand; boiling water
caused it to give out a green light, which was so greatly
intensified when the specimen rested on a live coal that
the radiance could be discerned from a considerable distance.
Similar phenomena were observable in the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
of chlorophane from Amelia Court House, Va., and the
writer found that specimens from this source also exhibited
strong triboluminescence, resulting either from contact
with one another, or with any hard substance.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>As the terms fluorescence and phosphorescence are
sometimes rather carelessly employed, it may be well to
note here that while both terms are used to denote the
luminescence of a non-luminous body resulting from the
action of light rays, of the electric current, or of radiant
energy of any kind, as well as from heat, fluorescence
signifies a luminosity which only continues so long as the
exciting cause is present, while phosphorescence means
a luminosity persisting for a longer or shorter period
after the exciting cause has ceased to operate directly.
The latter term therefore denotes a luminous energy
stored up in the formerly non-luminous body and emitted
by it for a certain time, at the expiration of which it
again becomes non-luminous. Other special designations
of induced luminosity in minerals are triboluminescence,
the emission of light as a result of friction and thermoluminescence,
a term used to denote light-emission excited
by moderate heating, even by the warmth of the
hand.</p>

<p>An old treatise in Greek, said in its title to come
from “the sanctuary of the temple,” and containing
material, partly of Egyptian origin, may help us to
understand something of the processes employed by a
temple priest to impress the common people by the sight
of luminous gems. The writer of the treatise declares
that for the production of “the carbuncle that shines in
the night” use was made of certain parts (he says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> “the
bile”) of marine animals whose entrails, scales and bones
exhibited the phenomenon of phosphorescence. If properly
treated, precious stones (preferably carbuncles)
would glow so brightly at night “that anyone owning
such a stone could read or write by its light as well as
he could by daylight.”<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>In the <cite>Annales de Chimie et Physique</cite>, the great
French chemist, M. Berthelot, discusses this matter and
expresses the following opinion<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The texts leave no room for doubt as to the employment by the
ancients of precious stones rendered phosphorescent in the dark by the
superficial application of tinctures composed of materials whose phosphorescent
quality is known to us. Although this luminescence, due to
an application of organic oxidizable materials, could not well be
durable, still it might be made to last several hours, perhaps several
days, and it could always be renewed by repeating the application.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of jewelled ornaments to heighten by their
luminosity in obscurity or in darkness the effect produced
by a sacred image, and to stimulate religious awe in the
beholder, is testified to by the ultra-Protestant traveller,
Fynes Moryson, Gent., who went to Italy in 1594. Of
his visit to the Santa Casa in Loreto, he says that he
himself and two Dutchmen, his companions, were permitted
to enter the inner chapel of the sanctuary,
“where,” he proceeds, “we did see the Virgin’s picture,
adorned with pretious Jewels, and the place (to increase
religious horror) being darke, yet the Jewels shined
by the light of wax candles.” Although there is no question
here of naturally luminous gems, this might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
been the impression produced upon a more sympathetic
pilgrim.<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>Writing of the traditions in regard to luminous stones,
Sir Richard F. Burton says, “There may be a basis of
fact to this fancy, the abnormal effect of precious stones
upon mesmeric sensitives.”<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> However, while some instances
are recorded of psychic impression produced by
precious stones on the minds of persons possessing a
highly sensitive nervous system, it seems likely that
some legends of luminous stones had their origin in the
refractive powers of cut gems, by means of which a dim
and distant light would be reflected from the surface of
the stones and would seem to spring from them. Quite
possibly, in other instances, there was a disposition to
cater to the popular belief by placing a light so that the
hidden beams traversed the stone and appeared to
emanate from it.</p>

<small>On Crystal Balls and Crystal Gazing</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">WE have evidence of the use of crystal balls as
means of divination in medieval times, and
“scrying” in some of its many forms was by no means
rare in the Greek and Roman periods. The essential
requisite for the exercise of this species of divination is a
polished surface of some sort upon which the scryer shall
gaze intently; for this purpose mirrors, globules of lead or
quicksilver, polished steel, the surface of water, and even
pools of ink, have been employed and have been found to
insure quite as satisfactory results as the crystal ball. The
points of light reflected from the polished surface (<i lang="fr">points
de repère</i>) serve to attract the attention of the gazer
and to fix the eye until, gradually, the optic nerve becomes
so fatigued that it finally ceases to transmit to the sensorium
the impression made from without and begins to
respond to the reflex action proceeding from the brain
of the gazer. In this way the impression received from
within is apparently projected and seems to come from
without. It is easy to understand that the results must
vary according to the idiosyncrasy of the various scryers;
for everything depends upon the sensitiveness of the
optic nerve. In many cases the effect of prolonged gazing
upon the brilliant surface will simply produce a loss
of sight, the optic nerve will be temporarily paralyzed
and will as little respond to stimulation from within as
from without; in other cases, however, the nerve will be
only deadened as regards external impressions, while
retaining sufficient activity to react against a stimulus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
from the brain centres. It is almost invariably stated
that, prior to the appearance of the desired visions, the
crystal seems to disappear and a mist rises before the
gazer’s eye.</p>

<div class="caption">ROCK-CRYSTAL BALL PENETRATED BY CRYSTALS OF RUTILE. MADAGASCAR.</div>
</div>

<p>The Achaians, as Pausanius relates, frequently used
a mirror to divine diseases or to learn whether there was
danger of sudden death. Of the Temple of Demeter, or
Ceres, at Patras, he writes:<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In front of the temple of Demeter there is a well. A stone wall
separates this well from the temple, but steps lead down to it from the
outside. Here there is an infallible oracle, although it does not answer
all questions, but only those touching diseases. They attach a slender
cord to a mirror and let it down into the well, balancing it carefully
so that the water does not cover the face, but only touches the rim.
Then, after making a prayer to the goddess and burning incense to
her, they look into the mirror, and it shows whether the sick person
will die or recover. Such is the power of truth in this water.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sacred well with its oracle of the magic mirror
must have been in Lucian’s mind when, in his description
of the palace of the Moon-King, he says:<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Another wonderful thing I saw in the palace. Suspended over a
rather shallow well there is a large mirror, and anyone who goes down
into this well will hear every word that is spoken on earth, while, if
he gazes on the mirror, he will see there every city and every nation
just as clearly as though he were looking down upon them from a slight
elevation. At the time I was there, I saw my native country and its
inhabitants. Whether I myself was seen by them in turn, I am not sure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucian adds, with a fine touch of irony, “Anyone who
doubts this assertion needs only to go there himself and
he will find out that I speak the truth.” As no one has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
yet made a trip to the moon, the assertion is still uncontradicted.</p>

<p>In their religious legends the ancient Mexicans taught
that their god Tezcatlipuco had a magic mirror in which
he saw everything that happened in the world.<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> He was
sometimes named Necocyautl, “sower of discord,” because
he often stirred up war and strife among men, but
he was also lord of riches and prosperity, which he
bestowed and took away again at his will. To the influence
of this divinity were attributed many omens
and certain strange visions, announced by repeated
knockings.<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>In the Orphic poem “Lithica,” a magic sphere of
stone is described. The substance is called “sideritis”
or “ophitis,” and is said to be black, round, and heavy;
possibly some metal, rather than a stone, is designated
by these names. Helenus, the Trojan soothsayer, is said
to have used this sphere to foretell the downfall of his
native city. He fasted for twenty-one days and then
wrapped the sphere in soft garments, like an infant, and
offered sacrifices to it until, by the magic of his prayers,
“a living soul warmed the precious substance.”</p>

<p>A strange variety of divination by means of mirrors
placed on the heads of boys, who, with eyes blindfolded,
were supposed to perceive forms or signs of some description
in the mirrors, is noted by Spartianus in his life
of the Emperor Didius Julianus (ca. 133-193). This
ruler is said to have resorted to this form of divination,
and the boy entrusted with the task is asserted to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
announced the approaching accession of Septimius
Severus (146-211) and the dethronement of Didius
Julianus.<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>An indication that the usage of divination by means
of a silver cup existed among the primitive Hebrews has
been found in the story of Joseph and his brethren. In
Genesis xliv, 1-5, we read that Joseph concealed a silver
cup in the sack of grain borne away by Benjamin, making
of this a pretext for requiring the return of his
brethren. He sent messengers to overtake them and
directed them to demand the return of the cup, using these
words: “Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and
whereby indeed he divineth?”</p>

<p>The Arabic author, Haly Abou Gefar, tells of a golden
ball used by “the Magi, followers of Zoroaster,” in their
incantations. It was incrusted with celestial symbols and
set with a sapphire, and one of these magicians, after
attaching it to a strip of bullhide, swung it around, reciting
at the same time various spells and incantations.<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
Probably the magician, by fixing his gaze upon the brilliant
revolving sphere, gradually fell into a hypnotic
trance, during which visions appeared to him. These he
could afterward interpret to those who had sought his
aid to read the future, or obtain information regarding
things that were happening far away.</p>

<p>An important side-light on the beliefs of Western
Europe, in the fifth century, regarding crystal-gazing, is
afforded by one of the canons of the synod held about 450
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> by St. Patrick and the bishops Auxilius and Issernanus.
Here it is decreed that any Christian who believes
there is a Lamia (or witch) in the mirror is to be anathe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>matized,
and is not to be again received into the Church
unless he shall have renounced this belief and shall have
diligently performed the penance imposed upon him.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> In
this case, as in many others, the vision in the crystal or
mirror did not represent some former or contemporaneous
happening, but the figure of an evil spirit, who,
either by signs or words, imparted to the scryer the information
he was seeking.</p>

<p>The power to see images of evil spirits on the surface
of water was claimed by those called <i>hydromantii</i> in the
ninth century. This is attested in a work composed about
860 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, who characterizes
the supposed appearances as “images or deceptions
of the demons.” These diviners asserted that they
received audible communications from the spirits, and
they therefore evidently believed that the appearances
were realities.<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>Although, as we have seen, many different materials
were used for scrying, the preference was often given to
polished spheres of beryl; in modern times, however, the
rock-crystal is considered the best adapted for the purpose.</p>

<p>In his introduction to “Crystal Gazing,” by N. W.
Thomas,<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> Andrew Lang writes of what he terms hypnagogic
illusions—images which appear when the eyes are
closed and before sleep supervenes. When faces appeared
to him in this way, they were always unfamiliar
ones, with the single exception of having once seen his
own face in profile. The same was almost invariably true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
of landscape and inanimate objects. These forms seemed
to grow out of the bright points of light which frequently
appear when the eyes are closed, and Lang suggests a
similar origin for the visions of the “scryers”—namely,
the development of the images from dark or light points
in the glass.</p>

<p>In regard to this, we have an interesting passage in
the works of Ibn Kaldoun, a Persian writer, born in 1332,
who gives the following very acute analysis of the phenomena
accompanying crystal-gazing.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some believe that the image perceived in this way takes form on
the surface of the mirror, but they are mistaken. The diviner looks at
this surface fixedly until it disappears, and a curtain, like a mist, is
interposed between him and the mirror. Upon this curtain are designed
the forms he wishes to see, and this permits him to give indications,
either affirmative or negative, concerning the matter on which
he is questioned. He then describes his perceptions as he has received
them. The diviners, while in this state, do not see what is really to be
seen (in the mirror); it is another kind of perception, which is born in
them and which is realized not by sight but by the soul.</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the character and quality of the crystal to be
used, Abbot Tritheim, the master of the famous Cornelius
Agrippa, says:<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Procure of a lapidary a good, clear, pellucid crystal of the bigness
of a small orange,—<i>i.e.</i>, about one inch and a half in diameter; let it be
globular, or round each way alike; then you have got this crystal
fair and clear, without any clouds or specks. Get a small plate of
pure gold to encompass the crystal round one-half; let this be fitted
on an ivory or ebony pedestal. Let there be engraved a circle round
the crystal; afterwards the name: Tetragrammaton. On the other
side of the plate let there be engraved, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel,
Raphael, which are the four principal angels ruling over the Sun,
Moon, Venus, and Mercury.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>The four letters constituting the Tetragrammaton are
the Hebrew characters <i>yôdh</i>, <i>hê</i>, <i>wâw</i> and <i>hê</i>, יהוה. As
this divine name was regarded in later Judaism as too
sacred to be pronounced, the word lord, <i>adonai</i>, was substituted
for it in the reading of the Scriptures. For
this reason, when the vowel signs were added to the text
to indicate the traditional pronunciation, the consonants
Yhwh were provided with the vowels of <i>adonai</i> and the
name was therefore read Jehovah by Christian scholars.</p>

<p>The Persian poet Jâmi writes thus of a magic mirror
in the poem “Salamân and Absal”:<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>Roger Bacon (1214-1292) was probably the most
gifted man of the thirteenth century, and his writings
testify to an extraordinarily clear perception of the essential
principles of scientific research. However, his true
greatness was not generally appreciated in his own age,
and popular fancy wove about his name a fabric of
legend in which he appeared as an arch-necromancer and
magician. The curious old work entitled “The Famous
Historie of Fryar Bacon” gives a number of the strange
recitals which became current in England in regard to
Bacon’s wonderful powers.</p>

<p>One of these treats of a marvellous “glass” made by
the friar, in which events happening at far-distant places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
were mirrored. On one occasion two young men, between
whom the friendliest feelings existed, came to
Bacon and requested him to let them see in the mirror
what their fathers were doing at the time. The friar consented,
but the experiment, while successful, was the
cause of a terrible misfortune. The story is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Fathers of these two Gentlemen (in their Sonnes absence)
were become great foes: this hatred betweene them was growne to that
height, that wheresoever they met, they had not onely wordes, but
blowes. Just at that time, as it should seeme, that their Sonnes were
looking to see how they were in health, they were met, and had drawne,
and were together by the eares. Their Sonnes seeing this, and having
been alwayes great friends, knew not what to say to one another, but
beheld each other with angry lookes. At last one of their Fathers,
as they might perceive in the Glasse, had a fall, and the other, taking
advantage, stood over him ready to strike him. The Sonne of him
that was downe could then containe himselfe no longer, but told the
other young man, that his Father had received wrong. He answered
againe, that it was faire. At last there grew such foule words betweene
them, and their bloods were so heated, that they presently stabbed the
one the other with their Daggers, and so fell downe dead.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sceptre of the Scottish regalia is surmounted by
a crystal globe, two inches and a quarter in diameter,
and the mace by a large crystal beryl. In former times
these stones were regarded as amulets and their use was
traced back to the Druids. Sir Walter Scott tells us that
in his time they were still known among the Scottish
Highlanders as “Stones of Power.”<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>The testimony of John of Salisbury (1120?-1180)
shows that in the twelfth century, in England, divination
by means of the arts of the <i>specularii</i> was often practised.
The prelate writes that when a boy, he himself and
a companion a few years older received instruction from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
a priest who was addicted to the use of these magic arts.
This priest used to polish the finger-nails of the boys
with a consecrated oil or ointment, and then direct them
to look upon the polished surface until some figure or
form should appear. Sometimes the smooth, polished
surface of a basin was used. John of Salisbury regarded
it as a mark of divine favor that he himself saw nothing
upon the smooth and lustrous surface, but he states that
his companion observed certain vague and shadowy
forms. Certain names pronounced by the priest on these
occasions terrified the boy, for he believed them to be the
names of evil spirits; indeed, such was his reluctance to
participate in the unholy rites that his presence was believed
to interfere with the production of the phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>In another part of his “Policraticus,” John of Salisbury
states that the specularii claimed that their gift of
seeing visions on polished surfaces was never used to
injure any one, but was often useful in the detection of
theft and in counteracting magic spells.<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p>Under the comprehensive chapter heading: “How to
conjure the crystal so that all things may be seen in it,”
Paracelsus (1493-1541) declares that “to conjure” means
nothing more than “to observe anything rightly, to
learn and to understand what it is.” The crystal was
of the nature of the air, and hence all things movable and
immovable that could be seen in the air could also be
seen in the crystal or <i>speculum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>Paracelsus showed keen insight, and his conclusions
are excellent. One might add, however, that it is a fact
that these are images condensed in the double convex
lens, forming as it were, an internal crystal sphere.
These images are reversed, distorted and twisted, and
when they become visible to one who is expecting strange
things, they form mental impressions which it is often
very difficult to erase. Many crystal gazers are frequently
very highly wrought, nervous and susceptible,
and other influences uniting with the impressions produced,
may give the brain for a time the power to evolve
kaleidoscopic effects.</p>

<p>Directions for the use of an Erdenspiegel, or “earth-mirror,”
are given in an old German manuscript written
in 1658 by a Capuchin priest.<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> The mirror is to be set
about two inches above a board, and the questions to be
answered are to be placed beneath it. The scryer is recommended
to place three grains of salt upon his tongue,
whereupon he is to repeat a prayer and cross himself.
He now takes the mirror in his hand and breathes upon
it three times, repeating the words, “In the name of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.”</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been accomplished, the
following prayer, or rather invocation, is repeated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>O thou holy Archangel N. N., I pray to thee most fervently
through the great and unsearchable name of the Lord of all Lords and
King of all Kings, Jod, He, Vau, He, Tetragrammaton, Adonay,
Schaday, receive my greeting and give ear to the humble petition which
I offer in the name of the great and highest God, Elohim, Zebaoth,
that thou shalt appear to me in the world-mirror, and give me knowledge
and instruction in answer to my questions.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>The strong religious tone of these directions for the
use of the mirror and the fact that it is a priest who
gives them, shows that there was a disposition to tolerate
the employment of such “white magic.”</p>

<p>In medieval times it was believed that the vision in
the crystal was produced through the agency of an indwelling
spirit, and, therefore, it was necessary to use
some very potent spell to force this spirit to enter the
stone. Many of these ancient spells have been preserved,
and they contain a strange and incongruous mixture of
religious and magical formulas. In one of these, dating
from the end of the fifteenth century, after a recitation of
a long and rambling conjuration, we read: “And y<sup>en</sup> ask
y<sup>e</sup> chylde yf h<sup>e</sup> seethe any thyng, and yf no, let the m<sup>r</sup>
begin his conjuratyō agayn.” As usual the scrying was
done by a child, the conjuration being spoken by the minister.
An important part of the conjuration consisted
in the repetition of a number of divine names, most of
them originally Hebrew, but so much corrupted by reciters
who did not know their meaning that it is now
exceedingly difficult to interpret them correctly.</p>

<p>A proof that this form of magic was often regarded
as quite compatible with religion is offered us in a passage
from a sixteenth century manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> where we
read that the crystal should be laid on the altar “on the
Side that the gospell is read on. And let the priest say a
mass on the same Side.” If the conjuration is successful,
the same manuscript tells us that “these angells being
once appeared will not depart the glasse or stone untill
the Sonne be sett except you licence them.” It also seems
that “scrying” was looked upon as a special gift, only
granted to a favored few as a peculiar privilege, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
read that “Prayer and a good beleefe prevailed much.
For faith is the cay to this and all other works, and
without it nothing can be effected.” The child scryer,
either maid or boy, should not be more than twelve
years old.</p>

<p>That a certain religious spirit, however mistaken,
often animated the crystal-gazers of the sixteenth century,
is shown in the case of the “speculator” of John
a Windor, who confessed that when he led an impure life
the “dæmons” would not appear to him in his glass. He
would then proceed to fumigate the apartment, as though
believing that the very air was contaminated by the sins
of the operator. We may hope that the seer was not content
with this, but also tried to reform his evil ways.
Another scryer, a woman named Sarah Skelhorn, declared
that the spirits that appeared to her in the glass
would often follow her about the house from room to
room, so that she at last became weary of their presence.<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a>
Both of these scryers had regular employment, for it was
quite customary for a gentleman to have a household
seer, just as he would have a body-physician, if he could
afford it.</p>

<p>A sixteenth century work on magic, the “Höllenzwang”
of Dr. Faustus, whose name has been immortalized
for all ages by Goethe, gives very particular and
detailed directions for the preparation and consecration
of a crystal, whether glass or quartz. Faust asks his
“Mephistophelis” whether such crystals can be made,
and the spirit replies: “Yes, indeed, my Faust,” and
directs Faust to go, on a Tuesday, to a glass-maker, and
get the latter to form a glass. It was requisite that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
work should be done in the hour of Mars, that is, in the
first, eighth, fifteenth or twenty-second hour of Tuesday.
The crystal when completed must not be accepted as a
gift, but a price must be paid for it. When the object
had been secured, Mephistopheles directs that it be buried
in a grave, where it must be left for the space of three
weeks; it was then to be unearthed; if a woman purchased
it, she must bury it in a woman’s grave. However,
these preliminaries only served to prepare the
crystal for the final consecration, as the mere material
mass was regarded as inert and possessing no virtue
until certain spirits were summoned to dwell within it.
Mephistopheles confesses that he alone would not be powerful
enough, and he directs Faust to call upon the spirits
Azeruel and Adadiel also. Faust is assured that the three
spirits will show him in the crystal whatever he may wish
to know. If anything has been stolen, the thief will appear;
if any one is suffering from disease, the character
of his malady will be revealed, etc.<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>Another way of preparing a crystal glass or mirror
is given in the same work. After the glass has been
bought it is to be immersed in baptismal water in which
a first-born male child has been baptized, and therein it
is to remain for three weeks. The water is then to be
poured out over a grave and the sixth chapter of the
Revelation of St. John is to be read. Hereupon the following
conjuration should be pronounced:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>O crystal, thou art a pure and tender virgin, thou standest at one
of the gates of heaven, that nothing may be hidden from thee; thou
standest under a cloud of heaven that nothing may be hidden from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
thee, whether in fields or meadows, whether master or servant, whether
wife or maid. Let this be said to thee in the name of God, as a plea
for thy help.<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The visions seen in crystal gazing were often supposed
to be the work of evil spirits, seeking to seduce the
souls of men by offering the promise of riches or by according
them an unlawful glimpse into the future. Here,
as in other magical operations, there was both white
and black magic, recourse being had in some cases to
good, and in others to evil spirits. As an illustration of
the latter practice, a sixteenth century writer relates that
in the city of Nuremberg, some time during the year 1530,
a “demon” showed to a priest, in a crystal, the vision of
a buried treasure. Believing in the truth of this vision,
the priest went to the spot indicated, where he found an
excavation in the form of a cavern, in the depths of which
he could see a chest and a black dog lying alongside it.
Eagerly the priest entered the cavern, hoping to possess
himself of the treasure, but the top of the excavation
caved in and he was crushed to death.<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>The famous charlatan, Dr. Dee, who was for a time a
prominent figure at the court of Emperor Rudolph II,
was highly favored by Queen Elizabeth. The queen visited
him several times, and even appears to have consulted
him on political matters. In his diary the doctor
relates that the queen called at his house shortly after his
wife’s death, which took place March 16, 1575. Of this
visit he gives the following details:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Queen’s Majestie, with her most honorable Privy Council, and
other the Lords and Nobility, came purposely to have visited my
library: but finding that my wife was within four hours before buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
out of the house, her Majestie refused to come in; but willed to fetch
my glass so famous, and to show unto her some of the properties of
it, which I did. Her Majestie being taken down from her horse by
the Earle of Liecester, Master of the Horse, at the church wall of
Mortlake, did see some of the properties of that glass, to her Majestie’s
great contentment and delight.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was at Mortlake, on December 22, 1581, that Dr.
Dee made his first essay with his crystal ball. The proceedings
were conducted with a certain religious ceremonial,
and began with a pious invocation to the angel of
the stone. This celestial being soon graciously deigned
to manifest himself in the stone and—presumably by the
voice of the scryer—answered the questions put by those
present.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Dee used more than one
crystal in the course of his experiments; that now in the
British Museum is of cairngorm, or “smoky-quartz.”
This variety of quartz may have been chosen because of
the Scotch superstitions regarding its virtues; for, as a
rule, charlatans seek to avail themselves of already existing
superstitions in order to make their innovations more
acceptable.</p>

</div>

<p>To give assurance to those who consulted such crystals
that no diabolical agency was involved in the production
of the phenomena, it was customary that a child
should be the crystal-gazer. In Dr. Dee’s experiments,
however, it was usually the notorious Kelley, his <i>âme
damnée</i>, who undertook this task of interpreting the
crystal visions. The description given by Dee of a
little girl who frequently acted as the intermediary
of the higher powers suggests one of the fanciful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
creations of our great novelist Hawthorne. Her mystic
name was Madimi, and she is depicted as a pretty girl
about eight years old, and with long flowing hair. To
make her appearance more conspicuous, she was attired
in a silk dress with chatoyant effects in red and green.
At times, during the séances, this gay little figure could
be seen flitting about the study, rendered even more
whimsical and strange from its contrast with the piles of
dusty old books, the curiosities, and the magical instruments
collected there.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>This visionary maiden Madimi, of whom Dee relates
so much in his diary, was apparently a child of fancy, a
creation of Kelley’s fertile brain. The diary is somewhat
obscure in this particular and easily misunderstood;
but there can be little doubt that where Madimi
is represented as speaking, it is Kelley’s voice that transmits
to Dee her revelations. One passage, often overlooked,
gives evidence of this. Madimi has appeared and
is addressing her remarks to Kelley and to Dee by turns;
finally, Dee says, “I know you see me often and I see you
only by faith and imagination.” To this Madimi quickly
retorts, “pointing to E. K.” (Kelley), “That sight is
perfecter than his.” Evidently we must understand
this to signify something that Kelley has told Dee, for
the latter’s words show that he did not himself see the
little fairy pointing to his friend. In many respects little
Madimi may recall another “spiritual” maiden of whom
we heard much a few years ago, the sprightly little
Indian spirit “Bright Eyes,” whose love for candy and
jewelry was so very earthly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>Not only the quality of the crystal had to be considered,
but also its support and surroundings. Of this
we have an interesting instance in the case of Dr. Dee’s
crystal. In one of his manuscripts is recorded the fact
that on the 10th of March, 1582, Kelley saw in the crystal
a representation of the form and arrangement of the table
on which it should be set; particular instructions on the
matter were also directly imparted to the scryer by the
angel Uriel. The table was to be square, measuring two
cubits each way and two cubits in height; and it was
to have four feet. The material was to be “swete wood”
and upon it was to be placed the Sigillum Dei (Seal of
God) impressed upon the purest, colorless wax, the disk
being 1⅛ inches thick and 9 inches in diameter. It bore a
cross and the magic letters A. G. L. A., a transliteration
into Roman characters of the initials of the Hebrew
words signifying “Thou are great forever, O Lord.”
Four other and smaller seals were to be provided, one to
be placed under each leg of the table; each of these seals
being impressed with geometrical figures within or upon
which were the seven sacred names of God and the names
of the seven angels ruling the seven planetary heavens;
Zabothiel, Zedekiel, Madiniel, Semeliel [Semeshiel],
Nogabiel, Corabiel [Cocabiel] and Levaniel, the angels,
respectively, of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus,
Mercury and the Moon. There then appeared to the
scryer the figure of the table with the crystal resting upon
it. Of this it is said:<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>
<p>“Under the table did seeme to be layd red sylk to lye
four square somewhat broader than the table, hanging
down with four knops or tassells at the four corners
thereof. Uppon the uppermost red silk did seme to be set
the stone with the frame, right over and uppon the principal
seal, saving that the sayd sylk was betwene the one
and the other.”</p>

<p>It therefore seems that the prejudice in favor of a
black or at least a dark background for the crystal did
not appeal to Dr. Dee, and indeed the effect of color may
perhaps better serve to neutralize troublesome reflections
than does black.</p>

<p>The personages Kelley pretended to see in or around
the magic crystal were described by him to Dr. Dee in
the greatest detail, and this undoubtedly served to lend
more reality and authority to their communications. As
an illustration of Kelley’s inventiveness in this matter,
we may take his description of “Nalvage,” a spirit that
first appeared while the doctor and his famulus were in
Cracow, April 10, 1584, and was subsequently a frequent
visitor. The seer introduces his new “control” as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>He hath a Gown of white silk, with a Cape with three pendants
with tassels on the end of them all green; it is fur, white, and seemeth
to shine, with a wavering glittering. On his head is nothing, he hath
no berd. His phisiognomy is like the pictures of King Edward the
Sixth; his hair hangeth down a quarter of the length of the Cap,
somewhat curling, yellow. He hath a rod or wand in his hand,
almost as big as my little finger; it is of Gold, and divided into three
equal parts, with a brighter Gold than the rest. He standeth upon
his round table of Christal, or rather Mother of Pearl.</p></blockquote>

<p>When reading the words spoken by Kelley and so
carefully preserved by Dr. Dee, we are reminded, aside
from the archaic turn of speech, of the minute descriptions
so glibly given by modern mediums. It is true that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
lately, in America, the spirits of the former owners of
the land, of the blameless aborigines, seem to have acquired
a quasi monopoly of the intercourse with the
other world.</p>

<p>Most of the early records of crystal-gazing show conclusively
enough that the images revealed in the stone
were produced by the expectations, the hopes, or the
fears of the gazer. In many cases, indeed, the vision is
only prophetic because it determines the future conduct
of the person who consults the stone. Fully persuaded
that what has been seen must come to pass, he, or she,
proceeds more or less consciously to make it happen, to
fulfil the prediction.</p>

<p>As an instance of this we may take from an old German
book<a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> the tale of a lovelorn maiden who seeks the
aid of an enchantress to learn whether she will marry
her lover, upon whom her parents look with disfavor.
The mystic crystal is brought out wrapped in a yellow
handkerchief, and is placed in a green bowl beneath
which is spread a blue cloth, the reflections from these
different colors being probably calculated to stimulate
the optic nerve and favor the appearance of some picture
upon the polished surface of the crystal. The young
girl, in rapt attention, looks long and earnestly; at last
she cries out that she sees her own form and that of her
lover. Both look pale and sad, and they appear to be
about to set forth upon a long and perilous journey, for
the lover wears riding-boots and carries a brace of pistols.
The girl is so terrified at the sight that she faints
away. The sequel of this vision is a runaway match, and
we can easily understand that when the lover proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
this adventure, the girl believed that it was written in
the book of fate and willingly agreed to undertake it.</p>

<p>The great humorous poem “Hudibras,” wherein all
the foibles of the seventeenth century are castigated,
does not fail to make mention of Dee and Kelley and
their crystal. Of the sorcerer whose aid Hudibras seeks
we are told:<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In his experiments in crystal-gazing, Dr. Dee evidently
used more than one crystal, and did not indeed
confine the operations of his scryer or scryers to brilliant
spheres. In the collection of Horace Walpole, at
Strawberry Hill, was a polished slab of black stone,
obsidian, from Mexico. This came into the possession
of Mr. Smythe Piggott and later (1853) into that of
Lord Londesborough; it is now in the collection of
Prince Alexis Soltykoff. Horace Walpole wrote a
label for the stone, in which he says that it had
long been owned by the Mordaunts, Earls of Peterborough,
and was described in the catalogue of
their collection as the black stone into which Dr. Dee
used to call his spirits. Later it was owned by John
Campbell, Duke of Argyle, who gave it to Horace Wal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>pole.<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>
Undoubtedly any polished surface, whether flat
or convex, might serve the purpose of the scryer almost
equally well; the possible advantage of a convex or a
spherical form consists in the multiplying of the reflections
and light points so that the sight is induced to
wander from point to point, and that forms and even
motions are suggested by the superposition and combination
of the various reflections. Often, too, a light point
visible to one eye will not be so to the other, this sometimes
provoking the phenomenon of binocular vision,
which asserts itself for a moment or two, when the
diverse images coalesce again, though imperfectly, giving
an impression of movement. For one gifted with
imagination and the natural quality of visualizing brain-pictures,
these shifting light-points and the more or less
definite and repeated reflections of surrounding objects
offer abundant material out of which to construct lifelike
pictures apparently seen in the crystal. That the
brain-pictures thus thrown out, so to speak, upon the
crystal, may or may not have a peculiar psychic value,
other than their value as mere phenomena, depends upon
the significance we are inclined to attribute to the processes
of the subconscious intelligence; of its existence,
indeed, there can be no doubt, and many of our best
thinkers incline to the belief that through it the narrow
limits of our personality are occasionally transcended.</p>

<p>The following history and description of a crystal
ball is given by John Aubrey (1626-1697):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have here set down the figure of a consecrated Beryl—now in
the possession of Sir Edward Harley, Knight of the Bath, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
he keeps in his closet at Brampton Bryan in Herefordshire amongst
his Cimelia, which I saw there. It came first from Norfolk; a minister
had it there, and a call was to be made with it. Afterwards a
miller had it and he did work great cures with it (if curable), and in
the Beryl they did see, either the receipt in writing, or else the herb.
To this minister, the spirits or angels would appear openly, and
because the miller (who was his familiar friend) one day happened
to see them, he gave him the aforesaid Beryl and Call; by these angels
the minister was forewarned of his death. This account I had from
Mr. Ashmole. Afterwards this Beryl came into somebody’s hand in
London who did tell strange things by it; insomuch that at last he was
questioned for it, and it was taken away by authority (it was about
1645). This Beryl is a perfect sphere, the diameter of it I guess to
be something more than an inch; it is set in a ring, or circle, of silver,
resembling the meridian of a globe; the stem of it is about ten inches
high, all gilt. At the four quarters of it are the names of four angels,
viz: Uriel, Raphael, Michael, Gabriel. On the top is a cross patee.<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In his “Saducismus Triumphatus,” Joseph Glanvil
writes that “one Compton of Summersetshire, who practised
Physick, and pretends to strange Matters,” demonstrated
his power to evoke the image of a distant person
on the surface of a mirror. Glanvil relates that Compton
offered to show to a Mr. Hill any one the latter
wished to see. Hill “had no great confidence in his
talk,” but replied that he desired to see his wife who was
many miles distant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> “Upon this, Compton took up a
Looking-glass that was in the Room, and setting it down
again, bid my Friend look in it, which he did, and then, as
he most solemnly and seriously professeth, he saw the exact
Image of his Wife, in that Habit which she then wore
and working at her Needle in such a part of the Room
(then represented also) in which and about which time
she really was, as he found upon enquiry when he came
home. The Gentleman himself averred this to me, and
he is a very sober, intelligent, and credible Person.
Compton had no knowledge of him before, and was an
utter stranger to the Person of his Wife. He was by
all accounts a very odd Person.”<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>A contemporary record recites that when a certain Sir
Marmaduke Langdale (of the seventeenth century) was
in Italy, he went to a sorcerer and was shown in a glass
his own figure kneeling before a crucifix. Though a
Protestant at this time, he shortly after became a Catholic.<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
If we exclude all idea of trickery, it is likely
enough that the idea of becoming a Catholic was already
present to the scryer’s mind and called up this picture
before him.</p>

<p>The celebrated Cagliostro, a Sicilian whose real name
was Giuseppe Balsamo, among his other arts to excite
curiosity and play upon the superstition of his contemporaries,
had recourse to a species of crystal-gazing. In
the only authentic biography of this extraordinary impostor
occurs the following passage, which we give in
Carlyle’s version:<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cagliostro brought a little Boy into the Lodge, son of a nobleman
there. He placed him on his knees before a table, whereon stood a
Bottle of pure water, and behind this some lighted candles: he made
an exorcism round the boy, put his hand on his head and both, in this
attitude, addressed their prayers to God for the happy accomplishment
of the work. Having bid the child look into the Bottle, directly the
child cried that he saw a garden. Knowing hereby that Heaven assisted
him, Cagliostro took courage, and bade the child ask of God the
grace to see the angel Michael. At first the child said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> “I see something
white; I know not what it is.” Then he began jumping, stamping
like a possessed creature, and cried: “There now! I see a child
like myself, that seems to have something angelical.” All the assembly,
and Cagliostro himself, remained speechless with emotion.... The
child being anew exorcised with the hand of the Venerable
on his head, and the customary prayer addressed to Heaven, he looked
into the Bottle, and said he saw his sister at that moment coming down
stairs, and embracing one of her brothers. That appeared impossible,
the brother in question being then hundreds of miles off; however,
Cagliostro felt not disconcerted; said they might send to the country-house
where the sister was, and see.</p></blockquote>

<p>Taken all in all this experiment does not seem very
satisfactory; but we have in it all the essential phases
of crystal-gazing. Excitement and expectation produced
their usual effect upon an impressionable child, and suggestion
did the rest; the final vision may have been corroborated
in some way, or, if not, it would be explained
so as to convince those present at the experiment that
the child had really seen a representation of some actual
happening.</p>

<p>During the Terror, among those upon whom fell the
suspicions of the Jacobins was General Marlière. He
knew that a trial and quite probably a condemnation
awaited him. A few days before the date fixed for his
appearance before his judges, he met a colonel in the
French army, who had served in the American Revolutionary
War, and who was a firm believer in the truth of
the visions seen in crystal balls. In the course of the
conversation this subject was alluded to, and the general
immediately declared that he was eager to put the
matter to the test, and learn, if possible, what fate was
in store for him. The colonel was at first very unwilling
to undertake the experiment, probably he thought that
General Marlière’s doom was sealed, and, believing as he
did in the revelations of the crystal, he dreaded the re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>sults;
however, the general insisted and the experiment
took place. As usual, the medium was an “innocent
child.” In the crystal appeared a man wearing a private’s
uniform of the National Guard struggling with one
wearing a general’s uniform. The child was much excited
and terrified by the sight, exclaiming that the general’s
assailant had thrown him down and was beheading him.
That the vision portended the general’s execution was
clear enough, but the peculiar dress of the executioner
was a mystery to those present at the test, for the
official garb bore no resemblance whatever to a soldier’s
uniform. The prediction was, however, fulfilled to the
letter. General Marlière was tried, found guilty, and
guillotined. This in itself did not mean much in view of
the innumerable executions in the time of the Terror;
but, on the day of this execution, Samson, the official
executioner, desiring to gratify his personal vanity and
to attract the gaze of the spectators, dressed himself in
the uniform of a national guardsman.<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> That this altogether
unusual circumstance, which could scarcely have
been known to any of those who assisted at the crystal-gazing,
should have been revealed in the crystal, is certainly
very mysterious. If we had positive assurance
that the events narrated happened exactly in the way
they are said to have happened, this would be one of the
few instances in which the vision seen in the crystal reproduced
something entirely unknown to the scryer.</p>

<p>Many extraordinary visions are said to have been
seen in crystal balls by a French scryer whose grandmother
had clairvoyant powers and was sometimes consulted
by Napoleon I. It is claimed that the grandson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
has enjoyed the patronage of many royal personages,
and had predicted, in a more or less definite way, the
assassination of King Humbert of Italy, and the attempted
assassination of Alfonso XIII and of his young
bride, when they were returning to the palace after the
conclusion of the marriage ceremony. This French
scryer has stated that he is powerfully affected when
he is consulted by any one destined to die a violent death;
on such occasions he feels, in his own organism, a modified
form of the particular kind of suffering they are
fated to experience. This exceptional sensitiveness to
occult influences was also shown when the crystal-gazer
went to the Boulaq Museum in Cairo, and gazed
upon the rows of mummies exhibited there; he immediately
felt, as intensely as though it were a personal experience,
the mingled sorrow and rage of the disembodied
spirits at seeing their embalmed bodies exposed to the
view of the idle crowd, when they should have been permitted
to rest in their tombs until the hour of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>In England all those who attempted, with a greater
or less degree of success, to reveal the hidden secrets of
the future, were expressly designated as rogues and vagabonds
according to the terms of an act passed June 21,
1824.<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> Such offenders, on being duly convicted before
the Justice of the Peace, could be committed to the
House of Correction, “there to be kept at hard Labour
for any time not exceeding Three Calendar Months.”
This class of undesirable citizens comprised all using
“any subtle Craft, Means, or Device, by Palmistry or
otherwise” for the deception of his Majesty’s subjects.</p>

<p>The <i>h’men</i>, or diviner, of Yucatan, places great re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>liance
upon his <i>zaztun</i>, or “clear stone.” This may be
a quartz crystal, or else some other translucent stone;
but in order to serve for divining purposes it must be
sanctified according to special rites, gum-copal being
burned before it, and certain magic formulas recited,
which have been transmitted from generation to generation
in an archaic dialect. When thus rendered fit for
use, the diviner claims to be able to see in the depths of the
crystal the whereabouts of lost articles, and also what
absent persons are doing at the time he makes his observation.
Not only this, but the future is also laid bare
before his eyes. As these stones are supposed to possess
such miraculous powers we need not be surprised that
one of them should be found in almost every village in
Yucatan.<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>The Apache medicine-men are also fully persuaded
that crystals possess the virtue of inducing visions, and
they have used them for the purpose of finding lost property.
To aid in the recovery of stolen ponies is one of
the most important tasks of the Apache medicine-man,
and to this end his crystal offers great assistance. Capt.
John G. Burke relates that he made a great friend of a
medicine-man named Na-a-che by giving him a large
crystal of denticulated spar, much superior to the crystal
he had been in the habit of using for his visions. That
this was thoroughly satisfactory to the medicine-man
at least, is shown by his statement to Capt. Burke that
by looking into his crystal he could see everything he
wanted to see. Of the way this came about he did not
attempt any explanation.<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>The magic power supposed to dwell within rock-crystal
has been recognized in a peculiar way by some natives
of New South Wales. They have the barbarous custom
of knocking out one or more of the front teeth of their
boys at the obligatory initiation ceremonies, and on one
occasion Dr. Howitt was entrusted with the care of a
number of these teeth, which are believed to preserve a
certain undefined connection with the health and fortunes
of their former possessors, and on this account great
fear was expressed lest the custodian should place the
precious teeth in the same bag with some rock-crystals,
for the natives thought that the magic power of these
crystals would injuriously affect the teeth, and through
them the boys, from whose jaws they had been broken.<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p>In a paper entitled “The Origin of Jewelry,” read
before the British Association, Professor W. Ridgeley
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Australians and tribes of New Guinea use crystals for rain-making,
although they cannot bore them, and this stone is a powerful amulet
in Uganda when fastened into leather. Sorcerers in Africa carry a
small bag of pebbles as an important part of their equipment. So
it was in Greece. The crystal was used to light the sacrificial fire and
was so employed in the church down to the fifteenth century. Egyptians
used it largely under the XII Dynasty, piercing it along its axis
after rubbing off the pyramid points of the crystal, sometimes leaving
the natural six sides, or else grinding it into a complete cylinder.
From this bead came the artificial cylindrical glass beads made later
by the Egyptians.</p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Ridgeley believes that the primary use of
all these objects was because of their supposed magic
powers. He holds the same view in regard to cylinders
and rings, considering that the use of these as signets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
only became habitual at a later time, and he finds a proof
of this theory in the fact that unengraved Babylonian
cylinders and Mycenean gems have been discovered.
This is, of course, perfectly true, but does not in the
least prove that such ornaments may not have been originally
worn simply for purposes of adornment; unquestionably,
the custom of engraving them so as to render
them signets must have arisen at a much later date.</p>

<p>Flacourt stated that the natives of Madagascar used
crystals to aid them in divining. These stones, which
were said to have fallen from heaven, were attached to
the corners of the boards whereon the sorcerers produced
their geomantic figures.<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> Here, however, the crystals
were not directly used, but were only supposed to attract
influences propitious to the diviner’s efforts.</p>

<p>In the notes to the 1888 edition of the Chinese criminal
code, some curious details are given of a practice
called Yuan-kuang-fuchou (the magic of the round glittering).
While this designation certainly seems to indicate
the use of a polished sphere of some description,
the details given refer to a different practice. We are
told that when anything was stolen appeal was sometimes
made to a certain Sun-Yuan Sheng, who would then
hang up a piece of white paper and utter a spell, while
a boy gazed upon the paper until he saw the figure of the
thief. This magician was punished for carrying on an
unlawful practice.<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>The Mexicans made images of their god Tezcatlipoca
of obsidian, and the name of this divinity is interpreted
as signifying “shining mirror.” This is supposed to
refer to, or to have been expressed by, the brilliant effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
of the polished surface of the obsidian. Mirrors of this
material are said to have been used for divination in ancient
Mexico and the neighboring countries.<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> One of
these Mexican mirrors seems to have been employed by
Dr. Dee in his experiments in crystal vision.</p>

<p>A remarkable series of tests in the art of scrying,
given in the presence of Lane, the great Arabic scholar,
and translator of the Arabian Nights, illustrates the fallibility
of most of the evidence adduced in such matters,
for, at first, Lane was strongly impressed by the exhibition.
Although no crystal was used, the process of scrying
was precisely the same as in crystal-gazing,—that is
to say, the vision called for by the visitors was seen by
the scryer on a polished surface. The master of ceremonies
was an Arab magician, though, of course, he did
not do the scrying himself, but employed a boy for this
purpose, for it is generally thought that half-grown boys
or girls are more receptive. Although Lane himself was
perfectly familiar with Arabic, an interpreter was always
present in the interest of the other Europeans who assisted
at the experiments.</p>

<p>After invoking many mysterious geniuses and burning
incense and scraps of paper inscribed with magic formulas,
the magician drew a magic square on a large sheet
of paper and dropped a quantity of ink in the centre. On
this the boy was directed to fix his gaze, and after he had
shown that he was thoroughly under the magician’s influence,
by describing the images suggested to him, the
visitors were permitted to ask him questions. The answers
were successful in most cases; a single instance
will suffice. When the boy was asked to describe Admiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Nelson, he replied: “I see a man clothed in a dark garb;
there is something strange about him, he has but one
arm.” Then, quickly correcting himself, he added: “No,
I was mistaken, he has one of his arms across his breast.”
This correction impressed those present more than the
first statement, for it was well known that Nelson usually
had the empty sleeve of his coat pinned to his breast.
It also seemed as though there could be no collusion, for
both the magician and the boy were ignorant of everything
English and evidently knew nothing of Nelson.
Unfortunately, however, for those who would fain believe
that there is something supernatural in scrying, it was
later discovered that the interpreter was a renegade
Scotchman, masquerading as an Arab, and there can be
little doubt that he managed to suggest the boy’s answer.
The fact that no satisfactory results were obtained when
this interpreter was absent, makes this explanation
almost certainly the correct one.</p>

<p>The Armenians sometimes practised divination by
watching the images that appeared, or were supposed to
appear, on the smooth surface of the waters of a well,
and the person who saw such images was called <i>hornaiogh</i>,
“he who looks into a well.” An Arab woman
living in the neighborhood of Constantinople enjoyed a
great reputation for her power in this respect, and was
frequently consulted by Armenians and by other dwellers
in the Turkish capital. Whoever wished to question
this woman regarding the cause of an illness, the whereabouts
of stolen objects, etc., usually took along a child
of the household, and the actual scrying was generally
performed by this child, who would describe or identify
the forms it saw on the water’s surface. If, however, for
one reason or another, no child was brought, the witch
herself did the scrying. In regard to illness, a distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
was made between “natural” maladies and those directly
caused by some spirit. Should the spirit (<i>peri</i>)
supposed to cause the dire malady known as <i>drsévé</i>, a
kind of consumption, be seen to glide over the surface
of the water, the sorceress would find it necessary to invoke
the whole race of <i>peris</i> to come to the aid of the
patient, who was expected to pay more than the usual fee
for this very special service.<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>The <i>peris</i> of Armenian legend were sometimes good
and sometimes evil spirits; in the former case these were
supposed to perform the functions of guardian angels,
and every one was said to have a peri especially delegated
to watch over him. This found expression in the
fact that when one Armenian felt at first sight an instinctive
sympathy for another, he would say, “My peri
loves you dearly (<i lang="hy">peris chad siretz kezi</i>).” In the contrary
case, the feeling of antipathy was also attributed
to the attitude assumed by the guardian spirit toward
the new acquaintance.<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> These spirits were therefore
supposed to encourage or discourage greater intimacy
with newcomers in accord with the true interests of those
over whom they watched.</p>

<p>The power to see images in a crystal does not appear
to depend to any great extent upon a morbid nervous
condition of the seer, for many of the most successful
experimenters have been of good and even of exceptionally
vigorous physique. Indeed, illness seems to diminish
or destroy this power, at least in the case of those who
are habitually healthy.<a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> This does not imply that some
highly nervous and even hysterical individuals have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
been favored with “crystal visions.” Very probably the
rule here is the same as in ordinary hypnotism. Those
persons who have a strong will and sound nerves are
able to hypnotize themselves, while those whose nerves
are disordered are subject to the hypnotic influence of
others.</p>

<p>A well-known lady in New York City, in conversation
with the writer, a few years ago, on the subject of crystal
balls, was advised by him to try a ball herself and see
what results she obtained. At the end of two years she
found that by concentration she had been able to better
her understanding of herself; and this effect is not only
obtainable now by means of a crystal ball, but by fixing
her gaze upon any bright object. This visual fixation
has centred her whole being in such a way that her health
has notably improved.</p>

<p>What are the laws that govern the production of these
phenomena? That the “visions” are real enough has
been proven time and again, but it seems almost certain
that they do not offer anything but the ideas or impressions
existing in the minds or optic nerves of the gazers.
One of the most painstaking students of the subject, Miss
Goodrich-Freer, gives many instances in proof of this,
which show how easy it would be for a less critical observer
to suppose that the crystal revealed something
unknown to the gazer. On one occasion this lady was at
a loss to remember the correct address of a friend whose
letter, received a few days before, she had torn up. She
resorted to her crystal, and after a few minutes saw in
it, in gray letters on a white ground, the address she had
forgotten. She mailed her answer to this address, and
the reply came duly to hand, with the address stamped
in gray upon the white paper of the note, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
identical with that she had first received.<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The visual
impression had been stirred up and “externalized” itself
when she gazed upon the crystal. We believe that this
explains the larger number of such visions, and that the
rest are only inexplicable because the scryer has forgotten
the source of the impression that is projected on
the surface of the crystal.</p>

<p>It is true that both Miss Goodrich-Freer and many
other crystal-gazers note instances in which the vision
appears to represent something the scryer does not and
cannot know. However, even in these cases, when carefully
examined, there is little difficulty in finding an explanation.
Coincidence accounts for much, and imagination
for more, since it is not the vision itself, but the
memory of the vision, that is later brought into comparison
with actual facts. We all know how exceedingly hard
it is to repeat, after a short lapse of time, all the circumstances
and details of any occurrence. There is a natural
growth and modification of mental impressions, due to
association of ideas, and where there exists the least wish
to make the prophecy accord with the event, or the vision
with the coincident happening, this growth and modification
will be in the direction of agreement. This takes
place quite unconsciously, and the informant will be fully
persuaded that all the circumstances are related exactly
as they occurred.</p>

<p>The attempt to identify either persons or scenes observed
by the scryer with real persons and real scenes
unknown to him, must always be open to the objection
that the one who makes the identification has no photographic
impression upon which to base his judgment, but
merely the words of the scryer. When we remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
what mistakes have been made in identifying individuals
from photographs, we can easily appreciate the great
chances of error entailed by the use of a verbal description
of a visionary experience, even when the person
giving the description is both willing and able to make it
as exact and adequate as possible.</p>

<p>A very impartial witness, Andrew Lang, states that,
in the course of a series of experiments he made in crystal-gazing,
he saw nothing himself, but found that a surprisingly
large proportion of those who tried were successful
in seeing pictures of some sort on the polished
surface. Almost invariably, when the gazer fixed his eyes
upon the sphere, it appeared to grow milky-hued and
then became black; upon this dark background the pictures
showed themselves. One of the scryers, a lady, said
that as a child she had seen pictures in ink that she had
spilled for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> This method has been much
favored by Orientals. While Lang does not quite venture
to assert that all the “visions” reported to him were
genuine ones, he inclines to the belief that this was the
case with many of them. Experience has shown, however,
that not all of those who see pictures in, or on, a
glass or crystal sphere, can also see them in ink.<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Nevertheless,
in view of the fact that the crystal sphere is said
to appear black to the eye before the pictures are seen,
it would seem that some naturally black surface would
be particularly adapted for the purpose.</p>

<p>An interesting point regarding the phenomena of
crystal-gazing is the effect produced by magnification
upon the images seen in, or on, the crystal ball. As to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
this matter there is considerable difference of opinion,
for, while some experimenters assert that the interposition
of a magnifying-glass enlarges the image, others
have not remarked any difference in its size under these
conditions. Indeed, one of the most critical witnesses,
Mrs. A. W. Verrall, declares that her vision entirely
disappeared when she held a magnifying-glass before her
eyes. On the other hand, we have the case of a subject
who had been told, while in the hypnotic state, that he
would see a play-bill on the crystal. When he was awakened
and the crystal ball was placed before him, he said
that he could see only detached letters, but when he
looked through a magnifying-glass he saw all the letters
distinctly and read the name of the play, in perfect accord
with the suggestion.<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>This image may have been reflected from some part of
the room where the gazer had not noticed it, and may
have been either before or behind the operator. The
magnifying-glass would naturally make the small, condensed
letters legible, as a play-bill would be many times
larger than a crystal ball, and its minute image naturally
too small to read, being reduced by the circular
surface.</p>

<p>Usually, however, the image is not on the surface of
the crystal, but in the beholder’s eye; therefore when
this image appears more clearly under magnification,
the result is due to the expectation of the gazer based
upon his experience of an invariable rule. This acts
as a stimulus upon the visual function, which must be
in an exceedingly sensitive state to produce visions at
all. When, however, no result or a negative result follows
the use of the glass, then we can safely assume that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the gazer was naturally of a critical turn of mind, and
was disposed to distrust sensual impressions; hence the
glass became a disturbing influence, interfering with or
even completely obliterating the eye-picture.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to establish distinctions
between the different materials used for crystals,
proceeding on the theory that subtle emanations from
them affected the gazer and played an important part in
producing the desired vision. That the beryl produced a
greater number of these visions than any other mineral
was the old belief which is still upheld in some quarters
to-day; one scryer, indeed, asserts that his clearest and
most satisfactory visions were seen in a cube of blue
beryl, the beautiful color appearing to dispose the soul
to a harmonious unfolding of its latent aptitudes.<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>Among the instructions given to a would-be crystal
gazer, the question of a proper and wholesome diet is
not overlooked, as anything which tends to disturb the
serenity of the organism will also interfere with the due
exercise of the special clairvoyant faculty that expresses
itself in crystal visions. A curious special recommendation
made by one of the exponents of the art is that
good results can be had by drinking an infusion of mugwort
(<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>), or of chicory (<i>Cichorium
intybus</i>), because of their tonic and antibilious qualities.
Moreover, we are told that these herbs are under the
influence of the zodiacal sign Libra, the sign controlling
the virtues of the beryl.<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Above all the portion of the
lunar month when the moon is on the increase is said
to be far the best season for scrying, as the old astrologers
recognized an affinity between the moon and rock-crystal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>The claim is made that the adept at crystal-gazing
can determine by the apparent difference in proximity of
the visions whether they refer to the present or to a more
or less remote past or future, that is to say, are nearer
or farther removed in time from the period when the
vision appears. The distinction between past and future
is admitted to offer greater difficulty and a decision as to
this point must depend upon a kind of intuitive and undefined
impression on the part of the scryer.</p>

<p>Those who have made a sympathetic study of crystal-gazing
recognize that the “visions” seen in or on the
crystal differ according to the mental and psychic temperament
of the scryer. Two broad distinctions are
sometimes established, the one class comprising those
whose mental attitude is a “positive” one while the second
class includes the “passive” subjects. In the former
case the crystal visions are more apt to be symbols denoting
some past or future event than a clear picture of the
event itself, the mentality of the “positive” subject being,
perhaps, too strong merely to mirror the image cast
upon it. Instead of so doing it transforms the impression
received from this image into some symbolic form. This
process is not, however, consciously done, but the scryer
of this type is supposed nevertheless to have an instinctive
appreciation of the fact that what he sees is purely
and simply a symbol, and he proceeds to interpret this
in accord with certain generally received rules, or in
accord with his own personal experience.</p>

<p>The passive subject on the other hand is more apt to
see a clear and definite picture of the persons or events
revealed to him. Sometimes that picture is distinctly
perceptible on or about the surface of the crystal, while
at other times the visual perception will be rather indefinite
and clouded, although accompanied by a strong men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>tal
impression in itself equivalent to that which would
have been induced by an actual and objective vision.<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p>The proper use of the crystal is the prime factor in
the art of scrying and great attention is paid to this point
by all those who treat seriously of the subject. Among
other things they recognize that freedom from pain, or
even from a sense of physical discomfort, is quite essential,
for the mind must assume a purely passive and
receptive attitude, and not be forced to take cognizance
of bodily discomfort. Moreover the nervous system must
be in repose, for which reason a reasonable time should
be allowed to lapse after taking a meal, before trying for
crystal visions.<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>An author on “psychomancy” affirms that fixing the
gaze upon a crystal ball is one of the very best means of
bringing out the latent faculty of astral vision, and he
finds a reason for this in the atomic structure, the molecular
arrangement of the material. He does not, however,
impart any definite information as to what special structural
characteristics render glass or rock-crystal particularly
efficient in this direction.<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> The help that may be
derived from crystal-gazing by those who are striving to
pierce the veil that separates the “real life” about us
from that spiritual life which is so much more real for
those who believe in it, is also admitted by many.<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>We cannot refrain from citing here the words spoken
by Sir Oliver Lodge at Birmingham, Sept. 10, 1913, before
the British Association for the Advancement of Science,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
affirming his conviction, as a result of scientific investigation
of occult phenomena, “that memory and affection
are not limited to that association with matter by which
alone they can manifest themselves here and now, and
that personality persists beyond bodily death.”</p>

<p>One of the latest types of glass balls for crystal-gazing
has a small, circular, flat surface on the sphere. This
may possibly be of service in furnishing a better field for
the expected vision, and may also lessen the troublesome
and baffling reflections which interfere so seriously with
the projection of the mental picture.</p>

<p>A method that has been recommended to crystal-gazers
is to place the crystal on a table, protect it from
the reflections of surrounding objects by means of a
velvet screen, and set seven candlesticks with wax tapers
in front of the screen. The tapers are then to be lighted,
the room being otherwise in perfect darkness, and the
would-be scryer is to seat himself comfortably before
the table, laying his hands flat upon it, and to gaze fixedly
upon the crystal for half an hour or longer. The light
from the tapers will certainly ensure a multitude of light
points in the crystal. That the molecules forming the
sphere may always remain <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with the gazer,
he is advised to put it beneath his pillow when retiring
to rest.<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p>The crystal gazer is strongly advised by some to limit
the duration of his experiment at first to five minutes,
during which he is to avoid thinking of anything in particular
while keeping his eyes fixed intently upon the
ball, but without any undue straining of attention. Should
the eyes “water” after the test is concluded, this is to
be regarded as an indication that the gazer has persisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
too long; for brain-fag is to be strictly avoided, as such
a state depresses instead of arousing the hidden and
higher psychic faculties. Even after considerable practice,
the scrying should not be carried on for more than a
few minutes at a time. The faculty of visualization plays
a most important part in crystal-gazing. The image
thought to be seen on, before, or behind the surface of
the crystal, is in its essence a fancied projection of a
purely mental image conceived in the brain; such an
image as is present to the consciousness of many when
they call to mind a scene of some vivid past experience,
or the face of someone they have known, and see it as an
element of consciousness. When it is possible to externalize
this interior vision, then we have at least a beginning
of successful scrying. That it may go far beyond
this, that it may reveal to the gazer events happening
in some distant place, or even events yet to transpire in
the dim future, is often claimed. An acceptance of this
claim must depend largely upon our attitude toward
premonitions and prophecies in general. Here, as in the
simple picture evolved by an image of the past, the crystal
is merely the background upon which are cast the
mind-pictures or soul-pictures arising within our being.<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p>A use of crystal gazing to aid literary composition
has been reported in the case of an English authoress of
note, who, if she lost the thread of the story she was
writing, would resort to her crystal, and would see mirrored
therein the scenes and personages of her tale, the
latter carrying on the plot in dramatic action. Aided
by this suggestion she was able to resume her composition
and successfully terminate her story.</p>

<div class="caption">CRYSTAL BALL, SUPPORTED BY BRONZE DRAGON. JAPANESE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>In Japan the smaller rock-crystals were believed to
be the congealed breath of the White Dragon, while the
larger and more brilliant ones were said to be the saliva
of the Violet Dragon. As the dragon was emblematic
of the highest powers of creation, this indicates the esteem
in which the substance was held by the Japanese,
who probably derived their appreciation of it from the
Chinese. The name <i>suisho</i>, used both in China and
Japan to designate rock-crystal, reflects the idea current
in ancient times, and repeated even by seventeenth
century writers, that rock-crystal was ice which had been
so long congealed that it could not be liquefied.</p>

<p>For the Japanese, rock-crystal is the “perfect jewel,”
<i>tama</i>; it is at once a symbol of purity and of the infinity
of space, and also of patience and perseverance. This
latter significance probably originating from an observation
of the patience and skill shown by the accurate
and painstaking Japanese cutters and polishers of rock-crystal.</p>

<p>A crystal ball, one of the largest perfect spheres ever
produced, has been made from rock-crystal of Madagascar.
It is a very perfect sphere and of faultless material.
The diameter is 6⅛ inches and the ball was held at about
$20,000.</p>

<p>Many fine crystal balls are made in Japan, the materials
being found in large, clear masses in the mountains
on the islands of Nippon and Fusiyama and also in the
granitic rocks of Central Japan. It is stated, however,
that much of the Japanese material really comes from
China. The Japanese methods of working rock-crystals
are extremely simple and depend more upon the skill and
patience of the workers than upon the tools at their command.
Our illustration, taken from a sketch made by an
Oriental traveller, shows the process of manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
crystal balls. The rough mass of crystal is gradually
rounded by careful chipping with a small steel hammer.
With the aid of this tool alone a perfect sphere is formed.
The Japanese workmen thoroughly understand the fracture
of the mineral, and know just when to apply chipping
and when hammering. The crystal, having been reduced
to a spherical form, is handed to a grinder, whose tools
consist of cylindrical pieces of cast iron, about a foot
in length, and full of perforations. These cylinders are
of different curvatures, according to the size of the
crystal to be ground. Powdered emery and garnet are
used for the first polishing. Plenty of water is supplied
during the process, and the balls are kept constantly
turning, in order to secure a true spherical surface.
Sometimes they are fixed on the end of a hollow tube and
kept dexterously turning in the hand until smooth. The
final polishing is effected with crocus or rouge (finely
divided hematite), giving a splendid lustrous surface.
As hand labor is exclusively used, the manufacture of
crystal objects according to the Japanese methods is extremely
laborious and slow.<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

JAPANESE METHOD OF CHIPPING, GRINDING AND POLISHING
ROCK-CRYSTAL BALLS.</div>
</div>

<p>In Germany and France and in the United States, the
fabrication of rock-crystal is accomplished almost entirely
by machinery. The crystal to be shaped into a ball
is placed against a semicircular groove worn in huge
grindstones. This is illustrated in the case of the
method practised in Oberstein, Germany. The workman
has his feet firmly braced against a support, and, resting
upon his chest, presses the crystal against the revolving
grindstone. It is unnecessary to add that the practice is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
extremely unwholesome and develops early consumption
among the workers. A constant stream of water is kept
flowing over the stone so that the crystal shall always be
moist, as the friction would otherwise hurt it, and the
subsequent addition of water would be liable to cause a
fracture. The final polishing is done on a wooden wheel
with tripoli, or by means of a leather buffer with tripoli
or rouge.<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p>There are three fine crystal balls in the collection of
the American Museum of Natural History. One, apparently
perfect, measures 5½ inches in diameter and was
cut from a crystal found in Mokolumne, Calaveras Co.,
California; the second is 6½ inches in diameter and is
from the same locality, but not entirely perfect. These
were shown in the department of the Tiffany Collection
prepared by the author, and were exhibited at the Paris
Exposition of 1900 as part of the J. Pierpont Morgan
gift to the American Museum of Natural History. Another
fine crystal ball is now to be seen in the American
Museum of Natural History, New York; this was donated
to the institution. It measures 4<sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inches in diameter,
is of wonderful purity, and the cutting has been executed
with such a high degree of precision that an ideally perfect
sphere has been produced.<a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>Crystal balls have been found occasionally in tombs
or in funerary urns, and their presence in sepulchres
may perhaps be considered to have been due to a belief
that they possessed certain magic properties. In the
tomb of Childeric (ca. 436-481 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>), the father of Clovis,
a rock-crystal sphere was found which was for a time
preserved in the Bibliothèque Royale, Paris, and later in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
the Louvre Museum; it measures 1½ inches in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>
The chance discovery of a number of crystal balls is related
by Montfaucon. Towards the end of the sixteenth
century, the canons of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome,
wished to have some repairs made to a house they owned,
just outside of the city walls, and sent thither some workmen
with the order to break up or remove two large,
superimposed stones, which were much in the way. The
workmen proceeded to break the upper stone, but were
much astonished to find embedded within it an alabaster
funerary urn with its cover. This had been hidden between
the two stones, a space for its reception having
been hollowed out in the upper and lower stones, so that
it fitted within them. Opening the urn there were found
inside, mingled with the ashes, twenty crystal balls, a
gold ring with a stone setting, a needle, an ivory comb,
and some bits of gold wire. The presence of the needle
was taken to indicate conclusively that the ashes were
those of a woman.<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></p>

<p>The discovery of the tomb of Childeric was made,
May 27, 1653, by a deaf-mute mason, named Adrien
Quinquin, while he was excavating for the restoration of
one of the dependencies of the church of Saint Brice de
Tournai. One of the most interesting objects found in
the tomb was the golden signet of Childeric bearing his
head and the legend <i>Childerici regis</i>. The earliest
description is given in a work by Chiflet entitled “Anastasis
Childerici,” “Resurrection of Childeric,” published
by Plantin of Antwerp in 1655. The various ornaments
were sent by the Spanish Governor-General of the
Netherlands to the Austrian treasury in Vienna, and
were not long afterward, in 1664, graciously donated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Emperor Leopold I to King Louis XIV, at the instance
of Johann Philip of Schonborn, Archbishop of Mainz,
who was under great obligation to the French sovereign.</p>

</div>

<p>In Paris the various ornaments were preserved in the
Bibliothèque Royale until the night of November 5-6,
1831, when many of them, with other valuables, were
stolen by an ex-convict. Closely pursued by the police,
the thief threw his booty into the Seine; much of the plunder
was subsequently recovered, but the signet of Childeric
was lost for ever. The crystal ball had not seemed
of sufficient value to tempt the thief and was left undisturbed;
it was later, in 1852, deposited in the Louvre
Museum.<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>In a personal communication to Abbé Cochet made
in 1858 by Mr. Thomas Wright, the latter stated that he
had seen at Downing in Flintshire with Lord Fielding
five crystal balls, bearing labels declaring that they came
from the sepulchres of the kings of France violated at
the time of the French Revolution. They had been purchased
about 1810 at the sale of the Duchess of Portland’s
effects.<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>Among the crystal balls found in French sepulchres
may be noted one discovered by Rigollot in 1853 at Arras,
and preserved in the Museum of that city; this still has
the original gold mounting serving to attach it to the
necklace from which it had been worn suspended. Another
found at or near Levas was in the possession of
M. Dancoise, a notary of Hénin-Liétard, dept. Pas de
Calais.<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> In the Bibliothèque at Dieppe there is a crystal
ball, 32 mm. in diameter, found at Douvrend, dept. Seine-Inferieure,
in 1838, in a Merovingian tomb; this is pierced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
through.<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> The department of Moselle supplied three
discoveries of this kind, crystal balls having been found
in a tomb at St. Preux-la-Montagne, Sablon and Moineville
near Briey, the latter measuring 36 mm. in
diameter.<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p>The Saxon tombs of England have also furnished a
contingent of crystal balls, for example at Chatham, at
Chassel Down on the Isle of Wight, where four were discovered,
at Breach Down, Barham, near Canterbury, at
Fairford, Gloucestershire, and also in Kent.<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>We should also note a crystal ball found in a funerary
urn at Hinsbury Hill, Northamptonshire;<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> this as
well as the one found at Fairford was facetted.<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> From
St. Nicholas, Worcestershire, is reported a crystal ball
1½ inches in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>In his “Hydrotaphia, or Urn Burial,” published in
1658, Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682), author of the
“Religio Medici,” relates that there was at that time
in the possession of Cardinal Farnese, an urn in which,
besides a number of antique engraved gems, an ape of
agate, and an elephant of amber, there had been found
a crystal ball and six “nuts” of crystal.<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>One of the largest and most perfect crystal balls is in
the Dresden “Grüne Gewölbe” (Green Vaults). This
weighs 15 German pounds and measures 6⅔ inches in
diameter; it was undoubtedly used for purposes of
augury. Ten thousand dollars was the price paid for it
in 1780.</p>

<p>A crystal ball known as the Currahmore Crystal, because
it is kept at the seat of that name belonging to the
Marquis of Waterford, has long enjoyed and still enjoys
the repute of possessing magical powers. It is of rock-crystal,
and the legend runs that one of the Le Poers
brought it from the Holy Land, where it had been given
him by the great crusader Godefroy de Bouillon (1058-1100).
The ball is a trifle larger than an orange and a
silver ring encircles it at the middle. The chief and
much-prized virtue of this crystal is its power to cure
cattle of any one of the many distempers to which they
are subject. Its application for this purpose is rather
peculiar, for the cattle are not touched with it, but driven
up and down a stream in which it has been laid. Not
only in the immediate neighborhood of Currahmore is
resort had to this magic stone by the peasants, but requests
for its loan are often made from far distant parts
of Ireland. The privilege is almost always accorded and
has never been abused, the crystal being in every case
conscientiously returned to its rightful owner.<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>The names “ghost-crystals,” “phantom-crystals,”
“spectre-crystals,” “shadow-crystals,” etc., are applied
to a form of quartz in which the crystallization was interrupted
from time to time, so that in the transparent
successive layers there is an occasional opaque layer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
often no thicker than the finest possible dusting of a
whiter material. Sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty
of these successive growths are observable, one over the
other. When these crystals are in the natural form, they
show beautifully from the sides and ends. Sometimes
such crystals are found after they have been rolled in the
beds of mountain torrents until they have become entirely
opaque, but when the surfaces are polished, the “phantom,”
“spectre,” or “ghost,” appears with wonderful
beauty. Occasionally the entire crystal has been worn
down to a small part of the original prism, in which case
it is cut into a ball. The ball may seem to be absolutely
pure, but when held in certain lights little tent-like markings
can often be observed; sometimes only one marking
is visible, but there may be as many as twenty. These
are occasionally due to a layer of smoky material, and,
though they add a charm to the ball, they detract from
its value. Nevertheless, crystal-gazers may find an additional
interest when the “ghostly” or “spectral” interior
exists in a crystal ball. This growth is similar in
kind to that seen at times in opaque quartz, forming what
is known as cap-quartz; here the crystallizations can frequently
be broken apart so that they fit one over the
other in many successive layers. Occasionally the regular
crystalline development will be interrupted, as it
were, and in place of the original crystal continuing its
growth harmoniously, a larger crystal will form on a
smaller one, forming a sort of mushroom, or “cap,” or
“stilt” quartz, as it is termed.</p>

<h3 class="h3l">Religious Uses of Precious Stones, Pagan,
Hebrew, and Christian.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE use of stones for the decoration of images of the
gods, and in religious ceremonies, more especially
in those connected with the burial of the dead, can be
traced back to a remote antiquity. Indeed, we may regard
this religious use of precious or peculiar stones as
the natural development of the original idea of their
talismanic virtue. If a certain supernatural essence manifested
itself in the stone, what more fit object could be
imagined for the decoration of statues of the gods, or to
bear engraved texts from the sacred writings, and to be
placed with the bodies of the dead as “passports” to
ensure the safe entry of the souls of the departed into the
better land?</p>

<p>While this employment of mineral substances for
religious purposes is practically universal, the earliest
recorded instances come from Egypt, and concern the
Egyptian custom of engraving texts from a very ancient
ritual composition, called the Book of the Dead, upon
certain semi-precious stones which had been cut into
various symbolical forms. This “Book of the Dead,”
composed of a number of distinct chapters, each complete
in itself, describes the passage of the soul of the
deceased through the realm of the dead (Amenti). Here
the soul addresses the gods and other beings who receive
it, and the prayers and invocations recited in the chapters
are supposed to procure a safe passage and protection
from all evil influences or impediments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>One of the most usual of the engraved amulets is the
buckle or tie (thet). This was generally of red jasper,
carnelian, or red porphyry, or else of red glass or
faience or of sycamore wood. The wood was symbolical
of the blood of Isis, and the amulets were sometimes engraved
with the 156th chapter of the Book of the Dead;
they were placed on the mummy’s neck. The formula
engraved reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Chapter of the buckle of carnelian which is put on the neck of the
deceased.</p>

<p>The blood of Isis, the virtue of Isis; the magic power of Isis,
the magic power of the Eye are protecting this the Great one; they
prevent any wrong being done to him.</p>

<p>This chapter is said on a buckle of carnelian dipped into the
juice of ankhama, inlaid into the substance of the sycamore-wood and
put on the neck of the deceased.</p>

<p>Whoever has this chapter read to him, the virtue of Isis protects
him; Horus, the son of Isis, rejoices in seeing him, and no way is
barred to him, unfailingly.<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another amulet is the <i>tet</i>. The hieroglyph represents
a mason’s table and the word signifies “firmness, stability,
preservation.” These figures, made of faience, gold,
carnelian, lapis-lazuli, and other materials, were placed
on the neck of the mummy to afford protection.<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>The “papyrus scepter,” <i>uat</i>, is usually cut from
matrix-emerald or made of faience of similar hue. <i>Uat</i>
means “verdure, flourishing, greenness”; placed on the
neck of the mummy it was regarded as emblematic of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
eternal youth it was hoped the deceased would enjoy in
the realm of the dead. In the 159th chapter of the Book
of the Dead, we read of an <i>uat</i> of matrix-emerald; it was
believed to be the gift of Thoth, serving to protect the
limbs of the deceased.<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>The amulet representing the pillow, <i>urs</i>, was generally
made of hematite. The 166th chapter of the Book
of the Dead is sometimes engraved thereon. Dr. Budge
renders this as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rise up from non-existence, O prostrate one! They watch over
thy head at the exalted horizon. Thou overthrowest thine enemies;
thou triumphest over what they do against thee, as Horus, the avenger
of his father, this Osiris<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> has commanded to be done for thee. Thou
cuttest off the heads of thine enemies; never shall they carry off from
thee thy head (?). Verily Osiris maketh slaughter at the coming
forth of the heads of his enemies; may they never remove his head
from him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all these amulets, the type most frequently encountered
has the shape of a heart, <i>ab</i>. These are found
of carnelian, green jasper, basalt, lapis-lazuli, and other
hard materials. The heart, regarded in ancient Egypt
as the seat of life, was the object of especial care after
death. Enclosed in a special receptacle it was buried
with the mummy, and the belief was that only after it had
been weighed in the balance of the underworld, against
the symbol of law, could it regain its place in the body
of the deceased. The heart was symbolically represented
by the scarab.<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<p>A fine example of a heart amulet shows on one side
the figure of the goddess Neith with the pennu bird or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
phœnix, an emblem of the resurrection, and bears inscribed
the chapter of the heart.<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>The following extract from the Book of the Dead
treats of the formula to be recited over a funeral scarab
cut from a hard stone, perhaps the lapis-lazuli. Egyptian
tradition assigned this chapter to the reign of Semti, the
fifth king of the 1st Dynasty, about 4400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Chapter of not allowing a man’s heart to oppose him in the divine
regions of the nether world.</p>

<p>My heart which came from my mother, my heart necessary for my
existence on earth, do not rise up against me, do not testify as an adversary
against me among the divine chiefs in regard to what I have
done before the gods; do not separate from me before the great lord
of Amenti. Hail to thee, O heart of Osiris, dwelling in the West!
Hail to you, gods of the braided beard, august by your sceptre! Speak
well of the Osiris N; make him prosper by Nehbka. I am reunited with
the earth, I am not dead in Amenti. There I am a pure spirit for
eternity.</p>

<p>To be said over a scarabæus fashioned from a hard stone, coated
with gold, and placed on the heart of the man after he has been
anointed with oil. The following words should be said over him as a
magic charm: “My heart which came from my mother, my heart is
necessary for me in my transformations.”</p>

<p>Take your aliments, pass around the turquoise basin, and go to
him who is in his temple and from whom the gods proceed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most ancient inscription of this especially favorite
text is on the plinth of a scarab in the British Museum
bearing the cartouche of Sebak-em-saf, a king of the XIV
Dynasty, 2300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> It is made from an exceptionally
fine piece of green jasper, the body and head of the beetle
being carefully carved out of the stone, while the legs
are of gold, carved in relief. The scarab is inserted into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
a gold base of tabloid form, and was found at Kurna
(Thebes) by Mr. Salt. As green jasper was believed to
possess altogether exceptional virtues as an amulet, this
particular scarab was probably regarded as especially
sacred.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>The Scribe Pa-bak: Let him say: “O Heart that I received from my mother (to be
said twice), O Heart that belongs to my spirit, rise not against me as witness, oppose me
not before the judges, contradict me not in the presence of the Guardian of the Scales.
Thou art the spirit that is in my body, Khnum that makest sound my limbs. When thou
comest to the place of judgment whither we go, cause not my name to be rejected by the
assessors, but let the pronouncement of judgment be favorable, and such as causes joy to
the heart.”</small></p></blockquote>

<p>It appears to have been the rule to engrave certain
special chapters of the Book of the Dead, among those
referring to the heart, upon particular stones. Thus, for
instance, the 26th chapter was engraved on lapis-lazuli,
the 27th upon feldspar, the 30th upon serpentine, and the
29th upon carnelian.<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> This may perhaps have been
originally due to some association of the god principally
invoked in the text with the precious substance upon
which the text was engraved.</p>

<p>The form of an eye, fashioned out of lapis-lazuli and
ornamented with gold, constituted an amulet of great
power; it was inscribed with the 140th chapter of the
Book of the Dead. On the last day of the month Mechir,
an offering “of all things good and holy” was to be made
before this symbolic eye, for on that day the supreme
god Ra was believed to place such an image upon his
head. Sometimes these eyes were made of jasper, and
could then be laid upon any of the limbs of a mummy.<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>Of the image of Truth, made from a lapis-lazuli and
worn by the Egyptian high-priest, Ælian aptly says that
he would prefer the judge should not bear Truth about
with him, fashioned and expressed in an image, but rather
in his very soul.<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>Among the Assyrian texts giving the formulæ for incantations
and various magical operations, there is one
which treats of an ornament composed of seven brilliant
stones, to be worn on the breast of the king as an amulet;
indeed, so great was the virtue of these stones that they
were supposed to constitute an ornament for the gods
also. The text, as rendered by Fossey, is as follows:<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Incantation. The splendid stones! The splendid stones! The
stones of abundance and of joy.</p>

<p>Made resplendent for the flesh of the gods.</p>

<p>The <i>ḥulalini</i> stone, the <i>sirgarru</i> stone, the <i>ḥulalu</i> stone, the <i>sându</i>
stone, the <i>uknû</i> stone.</p>

<p>The <i>dushu</i> stone, the precious stone <i>elmêshu</i>, perfect in celestial
beauty.</p>

<p>The stone of which the <i>pingu</i> is set in gold.</p>

<p>Placed upon the shining breast of the king as an ornament.</p>

<p>Azagsud, high-priest of Bêl, make them shine, make them sparkle!</p>

<p>Let the evil one keep aloof from the dwelling!</p></blockquote>

<p>The names of two of these gems, the <i>ḥulalu</i> and the
<i>ḥulalini</i>, suggest that they were of similar class. As the
fundamental meaning of the root whence the names are
formed is “to perforate,” it is barely possible that we
have here the long-sought Assyrian designation for the
pearl, which was commonly regarded in ancient times as
a stone. In Arabic the perforated pearl has a special
name to distinguish it from the unperforated, or “virgin
pearl.” All we know of the <i>sându</i> is that it must have
been a dark-colored stone. The <i>uknû</i>, however, is almost
certainly the lapis-lazuli. It is often mentioned in the
Tel el Amarna tablets as having been among the gifts
sent by the kings of Babylonia and Assyria to the Pharaohs
of Egypt, and also by the latter to friendly Asiatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
monarchs. Of the <i>sirgarru</i> and <i>dushu</i> stones nothing is
known, but the <i>elmêshu</i>, the seventh in the list, was evidently
regarded as the most brilliant and splendid of all;
indeed, Prof. Friedrich Delitzsch hazards the conjecture
that it is the diamond. In any case this stone must have
been set in rings and considered very valuable, for in an
Assyrian text occurs the following passage: “Like an
<i>elmêshu</i> ring may I be precious in thine eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> The
fact that this stone is described as having “a celestial
beauty” might incline us to believe that it was a sapphire.</p>

<p>The idea of this mystic ornament, composed of seven
gems, probably originated in Babylonia, where the number
seven was looked upon as especially sacred. As we
shall see, there is some reason to attribute a Hindu
origin to the nine gems, “the covering” of the King of
Tyre, enumerated by Ezekiel, while the breastplate on
the ephod of the Hebrew high-priest, with its twelve
stones, symbolizing the twelve months of the year, appears
to be of later date, and seems to belong to the time
of the return from the Babylonian Captivity and the
building of the second temple. Certainly, the historic and
prophetic books of the Old Testament know nothing of
it, although the Urim and Thummim are mentioned and
the elaborate description given in Exodus is generally
regarded by Biblical scholars as belonging to the so-called
“Priestly Codex,” the latest part of the Pentateuch,
gradually evolved during the Exile and given its final
form in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In the very ancient Assyrio-Babylonian epic narrative
of the descent of the goddess Ishtar to Hades, the guar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>dian
of the infernal regions obliges the goddess to lay
aside some part of her clothing and ornaments at each
of the seven gates through which she passes. At the fifth,
we are told that she stripped off her girdle of <i>aban alâdi</i>,
or stones which aided parturition.<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> It has been asserted,
and perhaps with some reason, that of the many
mineral substances supposed to possess this virtue, jade
(nephrite) or jadeite was the earliest known.</p>

<p>The Babylonian legends also tell of trees on which
grow precious stones. In the Gilgamesh epic a mystic
cedar tree is described. This grew in the Elamite sanctuary
of Irnina and was under the guardianship of the
Elamite king Humbaba. Of this tree an inscription relates:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It produces <i>samtu</i>-stones as fruit;</div>
<div class="verse">Its boughs hang with them, glorious to behold;</div>
<div class="verse">The crown of it produces lapis-lazuli;</div>
<div class="verse">Its fruit is costly to gaze upon.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another tree bearing precious stones was seen by the
hero Gilgamesh, after he had passed through darkness
for the space of twelve hours. This must have been a
most resplendent object, to judge from the following
description on a cuneiform tablet:<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It bore precious stones for fruits;</div>
<div class="verse">Its branches were glorious to the sight;</div>
<div class="verse">The twigs were crystals;</div>
<div class="verse">It bore fruit costly to the sight.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One of the rarest and most significant specimens
illustrating the use of valuable stones for religious cere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>monial
purposes in the pagan world is in the Morgan-Tiffany
collection. It is an ancient Babylonian axe-head
made of banded agate. So regular, indeed, is the disposition
of the layers in this agate that one might be justified
in denominating it an onyx. Its prevailing hue is what
may be called a “deer-brown”; some white splotches
now apparent are evidently due to the action of fire or
that of some alkali. This axe-head bears an inscription
in archaic cuneiform characters, and presumably in the
so-called Sumerian tongue, that believed to have been
spoken by the founders of the Babylonian civilization.
The form of the inscription indicates that the object dates
from an earlier period than 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<div class="caption">BABYLONIAN AXE HEAD.<br />
Agate, with inscription. Morgan collection, American Museum of Natural History, New York.</div>
</div>

<p>While the characters are clearly cut and can be easily
deciphered, the inscription is nevertheless exceedingly
difficult to translate. It is evident that the axe-head was
a votive offering to a divinity, probably on the part of
a certain governor named Adduggish; but whether the
divinity in question was Shamash (the sun-god), or the
god Adad, or some other member of the Babylonian pantheon,
cannot be determined with any finality. The
French assyriologist, François Lenormant, who first described
this axe-head in 1879, and Prof. Ira Maurice Price,
of the Semitic Department of Chicago University, both,
admit that it may have been consecrated to Adad. As
the weather-god, the thunderer, the axe-symbol would
have been more especially appropriate to him in view of
the usage, almost universal among primitive peoples, of
associating stone axe-heads or axe-shaped stones with the
thunderbolt, and hence with the divinity who was believed
to have launched it toward the earth.</p>

<p>This Sumerian axe-head measures 134.5 mm. in length
(5.3 inches), 35.5 mm. in width (1.4 inches), and 31 mm. in
thickness (1.22 inches). It was originally secured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Cardinal Stefano Borgia (1731-1804), for some time
secretary of the College of the Propaganda in Rome,
who probably acquired it from some missionary to the
East. From the cardinal’s family it passed for 15,000
lire ($3000) to the Tyszkiewicz Collection, and when the
objects therein comprised were disposed of at public
sale, the writer purchased it for the American Museum
of Natural History in New York, April 16, 1902.<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></p>

<p>At Alicante, in Spain, cut upon the pedestal of an ancient
statue, supposed to have been that of Isis, was
found an inscription giving a list of the offerings dedicated
by divine command, by a certain Fabia Fabiana in
honor of her granddaughter. Evidently the fond grandmother
had given of her best and choicest jewels which
were used to adorn the statue. They consisted of a diadem
set with a “unio” (a large round pearl) and six
smaller pearls, two emeralds, seven beryls, two rubies,
and a hyacinth. In each ear of the statue was inserted
an ear-ring bearing a pearl and an emerald; about the
neck was hung a necklace consisting of four rows of emeralds
and pearls, eighteen of the former and thirty-six
of the latter. Two circlets bound around the ankles contained
eleven beryls and two emeralds, while two bracelets
were set with eight emeralds and eight pearls. The
adornment was completed by four rings, two bearing
emeralds, while two, placed on the little finger, were set
with diamonds. On the sandals were eight beryls.<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>A notable instance of an antique votive offering is the
necklace of valuable precious stones dedicated to the
statue of Vesta. The Byzantine historian Zosimus attributes
the tragic end of Stilicho’s widow, Serena, to her
having despoiled the image of Vesta of this costly ornament,
and finds a sort of poetic justice in the manner of
her death, since she was strangled by a cord which encircled
her neck.</p>

<p>It is not only in the works of the Fathers of the Christian
Church that we find precious stones used as similes
of religious virtue, in Buddhist writings also we have examples
of this. In the “Questions of King Milinda,”
composed perhaps as early as the third century of our
era, occur the following passages:<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just, O King, as the diamond is pure throughout; just so, O King,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be perfectly pure in his
means of livelihood. This, O King, is the first quality of the diamond
he ought to have.</p>

<p>And again, O King, as the diamond cannot be alloyed with other
substance; just so, O King, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, never mix with wicked men as friends. This, O King, is the
second quality of the diamond he ought to have.</p>

<p>And again, O King, just as the diamond is set together with the
most costly gems; just so, O King, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, associate with those of the highest excellence, with
men who have entered the first or second or third stage of the Noble
Path, with the jewel treasures of the Arahats, of the recluses of the
threefold wisdom, or of the sixfold insight. This, O King, is the third
quality of the diamond he ought to have. For it was said, O King,
by the Blessed one,<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>The description of the New Jerusalem in the book of
Revelations finds a curious parallel in the Hindu Puranas.
Here we are told that the divine Krishna, the eighth incarnation
of Vishnu, took up his abode in the wonderful

<p>Gods, Asuras, Gandharas, Kinnaras began to pour into Dwáraká,
to see Krishna and Valaráma.</p>

<p>Some descended from the sky, some from their cars—and alighting
underneath the banyan tree, looked on Dwáraká, the matchless.</p>

<p>The city was square,—it measured a hundred <i>yojonas</i>, and over
all, was decked in pearls, rubies, diamonds, and other gems.</p>

<p>The city was high,—it was ornamented with gems; and it was
furnished with cupolas of rubies and diamonds,—with emerald pillars,
and with court-yards of rubies. It contained endless temples. It had
cross-roads decked with sapphires, and highways blazing with gems.
It blazed like the meridian sun in summer.</p></blockquote>

<p>As compared with the description in Revelations we
cannot fail to note the lack of definiteness. Instead of
the well-ordered scheme of color as represented by the
twelve precious stones dedicated to the twelve tribes of
Israel, the mystic Hindu city is simply a gorgeous mass
of the most brilliant gems known in India.</p>

<p>The poetic description of the royal city Kusavati,
given in the Maha Sudassana Suttanta, may perhaps
have originated in some tradition regarding Ecbatana or
Babylon. Seven ramparts surrounded Kusavati, the
materials being respectively gold, silver, beryl, crystal,
agate, coral and (for the last) “all kinds of gems.”
In these ramparts were four gates—one of gold, one of
silver, one of crystal and one of jade—and at each gate
seven pillars were fixed, each three or four times the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
height of a man and composed of the seven precious substances
that constituted the ramparts. Beyond the ramparts
were seven rows of palm trees, the fourth row
having trunks of silver and leaves and fruit of gold;
then followed palms of beryl, with leaves and fruit of
beryl; agate palms, whose fruit and leaves were of coral,
and coral palms, with leaves and fruit of agate; lastly,
the palms whose trunks were composed of “all kinds of
gems,” had leaves and fruits of the same description,
“and when these rows of palm trees were shaken by the
wind, arose a sound sweet and pleasant, and charming
and intoxicating.”<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<p>In Greek literature also there is a “gem-city,”—namely,
the city of the Islands of the Blessed, described
by Lucian in his Vera Historia.<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> The walls of this city
were of emerald, the temples of the gods were formed of
beryl, and the altars therein of single amethysts of enormous
size. The city itself was all of gold as a fit setting
for these marvellous gems.</p>

<p>Hindu mythology tells of a wonderful tank formed of
crystal, the work of the god Maya. Its bottom and sides
were encrusted with beautiful pearls and in the centre
was a raised platform blazing with the most gorgeous
precious stones. Although it contained no water, the
transparent crystal produced the illusion of water, and
those who approached the tank were tempted to plunge
into it and take a refreshing bath in what appeared to be
clear, fresh water.<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>The Kalpa Tree of Hindu religion, a symbolical
offering to the gods, is described by Hindu poets as a
glowing mass of precious stones. Pearls hung from its
boughs and beautiful emeralds from its shoots; the
tender young leaves were corals, and the ripe fruit consisted
of rubies. The roots were of sapphire; the base
of the trunk of diamond, the uppermost part of cat’s-eye,
while the section between was of topaz. The foliage (except
the young leaves) was entirely formed of zircons.<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p>The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Heuen Tsang, who
visited India between 629 and 645 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, tells of the wonderful
“Diamond Throne” which, according to the legend,
had once stood near the Tree of Knowledge, beneath
whose spreading branches Gautama Buddha is said to have
received his supreme revelation of truth. This throne
had been constructed in the age called the “Kalpa of the
Sages”; its origin was contemporaneous with that of the
earth, and its foundations were at the centre of all things;
it measured one hundred feet in circumference, and was
made of a single diamond. When the whole earth was
convulsed by storm or earthquake this resplendent throne
remained immovable. Upon it the thousand Buddhas of
the Kalpa had reposed and had fallen into the “ecstasy
of the diamond.” However, since the world has passed
into the present and last age, sand and earth have completely
covered the “Diamond Throne,” so that it can
no longer be seen by human eye.<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>In the Kalpa Sutra, written in Prakrit, one of the
sacred books of the Jains, the rivals of the Buddhists, it
is said that Harinegamesi, the divine commander of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
foot troops, seized fourteen precious stones, the chief
of which was <i>vajra</i>, the diamond, and rejecting their
grosser particles, retained only the finer essence to aid
him in his transformations. In the same sutra the following
glowing description is given of the adornment of
the surpassingly beautiful goddess Sri:<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>On all parts of her body shone ornaments and trinkets, composed
of many jewels and precious stones, yellow and red gold. The pure
cup-like pair of her breasts sparkled, encircled by a garland of Kunda
flowers in which glittered a string of pearls. She wore strings of
pearls made by clever and diligent artists, strung with wonderful strings,
a necklace of jewels with a string of Dinaras, and a trembling pair of
ear-rings, touching her shoulders, diffused a brilliancy; but the united
beauties and charms of these ornaments were only subservient to the
loveliness of her face.</p></blockquote>

<p>As engraved decoration of a fine Chinese vase of white
jade with delicate crown markings, appear eight storks,
each of which bears in its beak an attribute of one of the
Eight Taoist Immortals. Thus we have the double gourd
as attribute of the most powerful of these demi-gods
known as “Li with the Iron Crutch,” whose aid is sought
by magicians and astrologers; the magic sword, with
which Lu T’ung-pin vanquished the spirits of evil that
roamed through the Chinese Empire in the form of terrible
dragons; the basket of flowers, attribute of Lan
Ts’ai-ho, the patron of gardeners and florists; the royal
fan used by Han Chung-li, of the Chow Dynasty (1122-220
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), to call again to life the spirits of the departed;
the lotus flower, emblematic of the virgin Ho Hsien-Ku,
venerated somewhat as a patron saint by Chinese housewives,
and who acquired the gift of immortal life by the
help of a powder of pulverized jade and mother-of-pearl;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the bamboo tubes and rods with which the mighty necromancer
Chang Kuo, patron of artists, evoked the souls
of the dead; the flute of the musicians’ patron, Han
Hsiang-tzu, who owed his immortality to his craft in
stealthily entering the Taoist paradise and securing a
peach from the sacred tree of life; and, lastly, the castanets
of Tsao Kuo-chin, especially revered by Chinese
actors.</p>

<p>The prevailing belief in India, that treasures offered
to the images or shrines of the gods will bring good fortune
to the generous donor, finds expression in many
ancient and modern Hindu writings. In the Rig Veda it
is said that “by giving gold the giver receives a life of
light and glory.” In the Samaveda Upanishad we read:
“Givers are high in Heaven. Those who give horses live
conjointly with the sun; givers of gold enjoy eternal life;
givers of clothes live in the moon.” Another text
(Hâiti Smriti) reads:<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Coral in worship will subdue all the three worlds. He who worships
Krishna with rubies will be reborn as a powerful emperor; if
with a small ruby, he will be born a king. Offering emeralds will
produce Gyana or Knowledge of the Soul and of the Eternal. If he
worships with a diamond, even the impossible, or Nirvâna, that is
Eternal Life in the highest Heaven, will be secured. If with a flower
of gold a man worships for a month, he will get as much wealth as
Kuvera, the Lord of Rubies, and will hereafter attain to Nirvâna and
to Muskwa, or Salvation.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Multan, one of the most ancient cities of India,
situated in the Punjab, 164 miles southwest of Lahore,
there was in the Hindu temple an idol having for eyes
two great pearls. The eyes of the rude image of Jagganath
at Puri, in Bengal (Orissa), are said to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
at one time been formed of precious stones, as were also
those of the idols of Vishnu at Chandernagore and in the
great seven-walled temple at Srirangam, whence appears
to have come the Orloff diamond.</p>

<p>In ceremonial worship the Hindus recognize sixteen
offerings, the ninth consisting of gems and jewelry, and
a divine assurance of adequate return to the giver appears
in the Bhagavat Purana, where Krishna says,
“Whatever is best and most valued in this world and
that which is most dear to you should be offered to me,
and it will be received back in immense and endless
quantity.” On certain appointed days the holy images
are decorated with the choicest garments and the richest
jewelry in the temple treasury; this is especially the case
on the day celebrated as the birthday of the respective
divinity. However, the gifts are believed to retain their
sacred character as dedicated objects only for a comparatively
brief period, varying from a month or more for
garments and vestments, to ten or twelve years for
jewels, such as the naoratna or the panchratna, the
prized and revered jewels, composed respectively of
nine and five gems. The panchratna usually consists
of gold, diamond, sapphire, ruby, and pearl.
After the gifts have ceased to be worthy of use in the
temples, they may be disposed of to defray the expenses
of the foundation, including the cost of supporting the
numerous priests and attendants. As the objects still
retain their sacred associations, they are eagerly bought
by pious Hindus, who undoubtedly regard them as valuable
talismans. Thus they not only serve to bring blessings
upon the donors, but also constitute one of the chief
sources of income for the temples.<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>One of the oldest and perhaps the most interesting
talismanic jewel is that known as the naoratna or nararatna,
the “nine-gem” jewel. It is mentioned in the
old Hindu ratnaçastras, or treatises on gems, for example,
in the Nararatnaparîkshâ, where it is described
as follows:<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></p>

<p>From this description we learn that the jewel was
designed to combine all the powerful astrological influences.
The gems chosen to correspond with the various
heavenly bodies, and with the aspects known as the ascending
and descending nodes, differ in some cases from
those selected in the West. For instance, the emerald
is here assigned to Mercury, whereas in Western tradition
this stone was usually the representative of Venus,
although it is sometimes associated with Mercury also.<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a>
On the other hand, the diamond is dedicated to Venus,
instead of to the Sun as in the Western world.</p>

<p>Comprising diamond, ruby, cat’s-eye, pearl, zircon, coral, emerald, topaz, sapphire,
chrysoberyl, garnet, carnelian, quartz and rock-crystal. A pendant is the naoratna, or
“nine-gem” ornament, suspended from which is a pear-shaped pearl.</p>

<p>In possession of the late Rajah Sir Surindro Mohun Tagore, of Calcutta. From his
“Mani Málá,” Calcutta, 1879, Vol. I, iv-506 pp., 2 plates, portrait and plate; Vol. II, xiv +
ii 507-1046 pp. Contains 49 figures on 10 plates.</p>
</div>

<p>In the naoratna the five gems known to the Hindus as
the mahâratnâni, or “great gems,”—the diamond, pearl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
ruby, sapphire, and emerald,—were, as we see, associated
with the Sun and Moon, Venus, Mercury, and Saturn,
while the four lesser gems (uparatnâni)—namely, the
jacinth, topaz, cat’s-eye, and coral—represent Mars,
Jupiter, Râhu, and the descending node. The two last
named are very important factors in astrological calculations
and are often called the Dragon’s Head and the
Dragon’s Tail. These designations signify the ascending
and descending nodes, indicating the passage of the
ecliptic by the Moon in her ascent above and descent
below this arbitrary plane.</p>

<p>In three somewhat obscure passages of the Rig Veda
there are references to the seven ratnas. Whether these
were gems cannot be determined, since the primary
meaning of the word ratna is “a precious object,” not
necessarily a precious stone; but it is possible that we
may have here an allusion to some earlier form of talisman,
in which only the Sun, Moon, and the five planets
were represented.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that such a talisman as the
naoratna, combining the favorable influences of all the
celestial bodies supposed to govern the destinies of man,
must have been highly prized, and we may well assume
that only the rich and powerful could own this talisman
in a form ensuring its greatest efficacy. For the Hindus
believed that the virtue of every gem depended upon its
perfection, and they regarded a poor or defective stone
as a source of unhappiness and misfortune.</p>

<p>In modern times this talisman is sometimes differently
composed. A specimen shown in the Indian Court
of the Paris Exposition of 1878 consisted of the following
stones: coral, topaz, sapphire, ruby, flat diamond, cut
diamond, emerald, amethyst, and carbuncle. Here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
cut diamond, amethyst, and carbuncle take the place of
the jacinth, pearl, and cat’s-eye.</p>

<p>Instead of uniting the different planetary gems in a
single ring, they have sometimes been set separately in a
series of rings to be worn successively on the days originally
named after the celestial bodies. We read in the
life of Apollonius of Tyana (first century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) by Philostratus:
“Damis also relates that Iarchas gave to
Apollonius seven rings named after the planets, and the
latter wore these, one by one, in the order of the weekdays.”<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>
Although it is not expressly stated that the
appropriate stones were set in the rings, the custom of
the time makes it probable that this was the case.</p>

<p>Among the Burmese the value for occult purposes of
the nine gems composing the naoratna, or nararatna, is
strictly determined in the following order: first, the ruby;
second, the diamond, or rock-crystal; third, the pearl;
fourth, the coral; fifth, the topaz; sixth, the sapphire;
seventh, the cat’s-eye; eighth, the amethyst; and ninth,
the emerald.<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> That the ruby, diamond and pearl should
occupy places of honor is quite natural, but the rele<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>gation
of the sapphire to sixth place, after coral and
topaz, seems to be a rather unfair treatment of this beautiful
stone.</p>

<div class="caption">SCULPTURED JADE MOUNTAIN.</div>
</div>
<p><small>Probably the largest mass of sculptured jade in existence. The design commemorates the meetings of a literary club of the fourth century.
The Chinese characters (colored red) in the side of the cliff express the famous <i>Lan Ting Hsu</i>, or “Epidendron Pavilion Essay,” by Wang
Hi-che (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 321-379), ever since used by the Chinese as a model of elegant caligraphy, and were engraved directly from the autograph of the
Emperor Ch’ien-lung, written by him in 1784. Height 23 inches, width 38½ x 18½ inches; weight 640 pounds. From the Summer Palace,
west of Peking. Collection of T. D. Walker, of Minneapolis, Minn.</small></p>

<p>The yellow girdles worn by the Chinese emperors of
the Manchu dynasty were variously ornamented with
precious stones according to the different ceremonial
observances at which the emperor presided. For the
services in the Temple of Heaven, the very appropriate
choice of lapis-lazuli ornaments was made; for the Altar
of Earth, yellow jade was favored; for a sacrifice on the
Altar of the Sun, the gems were red corals, while white
jade was selected for the ceremonies before the Altar of
the Moon. Jade of different colors was used for the six
precious tablets employed in the worship of heaven and
earth and the four cardinal points. For the worship of
Heaven there was the dark-green round tablet; for that
of Earth, an octagonal tablet of yellow jade. The East
was worshipped with a green pointed tablet; the West
was worshipped with the white “tiger-tablet”; the North
with a black, semi-circular tablet, and the South with a
tablet of red jade.<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p>Of all the Chinese works on jade the most interesting
and remarkable is the <cite>Ku yü t’ou pu</cite> or “Illustrated Description
of Ancient Jade,” a catalogue divided into a
hundred books and embellished with upward of seven
hundred figures. It was published in 1176, and lists the
magnificent collection of jade objects belonging to the
first emperor of the Southern Sung dynasty. One of the
treasures here described was a four-sided plaque of pure
white jade over two feet in height and breadth, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
regarded as of altogether exceptional value, for on it was
a design miraculously engraven. This was a figure,
seated on a mat, with a flower-vase on its left and an alms-bowl
on the right, in the midst of rocks enveloped in
clouds. The figure was an image of the Buddhist saint,
Samantabahadra, and the plaque is said to have been
washed out of a sacred cave in the year 1068, by a violent
and mysterious current.<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p>Jade talismans are very popular at the present day
in the Mohammedan world, and among the Turks they
are so highly prized as heirlooms that it is difficult to
secure any of them. There is an orthodox Mohammedan
sect, whose members call themselves Pekdash, and who
during their whole lifetime carry about with them a flat
piece of jade as a protection against injury or annoyance
of every kind.<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p>The four rain-making gods are shown wearing necklaces
of coral and turquoise in the ceremonial sand-paintings
of the Navajos. These four gods are respectively
colored to denote the four cardinal points; black for
North, blue for South, yellow for West, and white for
East. The whole painting, measuring nine by thirteen
feet, is guarded on three sides by magic wands; toward
the East it is left unprotected, as only good spirits are
believed to dwell in this direction. Each of the rain-gods
carries suspended from his right wrist an elaborately
decorated tobacco pouch, bearing the figure of a
stone pipe. The Navajos believe that in this pouch the
god places a ray of sunlight with which he lights his pipe;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
when he smokes, clouds form in the sky and the rain descends.
In the sand-picture representing the God of the
Whirlwind this divinity also wears ear-pendants and a
necklace of turquoise.<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>Of the turquoise in Aztec times we have the testimony
of the missionary Bernardino de Sahagun that one variety,
presumably that regarded as the finest and most
attractive, bore the name <i>teuxivitl</i>, which signified “turquoise
of the gods.” No one was allowed either to own
or wear this as it was exclusively devoted to the service
of the gods, whether as a temple offering, or for the
decoration of the divine images. Sahagun describes this
turquoise as “fine, unspotted and very clear. It was very
rare and was brought to Mexico from afar. Some specimens
were of rounded shape, like a hazel-nut cut in half;
others were broad and flat, and some were pitted as
though in a state of decomposition.”<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>The god of fire, Xiuhtecutli, or Ixçocauhqui, presided
over the ceremony of piercing the ears of the young boys
and girls. The image of this god was decorated with
ear-rings encrusted with a mosaic of turquoise. He held
in his left hand a buckler on which were five large green
stones called <i>chalchiuitl</i> (jadeite), placed in the form of
a cross on a plate of gold almost covering the shield.<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>At the time of the Spanish Conquest an immense emerald,
almost as large as an ostrich egg, was adored by
the Peruvians in the city of Manta. This “emerald
goddess” bore the name of Umiña, and, like some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
the precious relics of the Christian world, was only exhibited
on high feast days, when the Indians flocked to
the shrine from far and near, bringing gifts to the
goddess. The wily priests especially recommended the
donation of emeralds, saying that these were the
daughters of the goddess, who would be well pleased to
see her offspring. In this way an immense store of emeralds
rewarded the efforts of the priests, and on the conquest
of Peru all these fine stones fell into the hands of
Pedro de Alvarado,<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> Garcilasso de la Vega, and their
companions. The mother emerald, however, had been so
cleverly concealed by the priests of the shrine that the
Spaniards never succeeded in gaining possession of it.
Many of the other emeralds were destroyed because of
the ignorance and stupidity of some of their new owners,
who, supposing that the test of a true emerald was its
ability to withstand hard blows, laid the stones on an
anvil and hammered them to pieces. The old and entirely
false notion that the genuine diamond could endure
this treatment may have suggested the unfortunate
test.</p>

<p>Garcilasso likens the growth of the emerald in its
mine to that of a fruit on a tree, and he believed that it
gradually acquired its beautiful green hue, that part of
the crystal nearest the sun being the first to acquire
color. He notes an interesting specimen found in Peru,
half of which was colorless like glass, while the other half
was a brilliant green; this he compares with a half-ripened
fruit.<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p>The remarkable jade adze, generally known as the
“Kunz adze,” was found in Oaxaca, Mexico, brought to
the United States about 1890, and is now in the American
Museum of Natural History, New York. Of a light
greenish-gray hue, with a slight tinge of blue, this jade
artefact is 272 mm. long (10<sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inches), 153 mm. wide
(6 inches) and 118 mm. thick (4⅝ inches); its weight is
229.3 Troy ounces, nearly sixteen pounds avoirdupois.
Rudely, but not unskilfully, carved upon its face is a
grotesque human figure. Four small, shallow depressions,
one under each eye and one near each hand, may
have served to hold in place small gold films, but no trace
of gold decoration is now extant. In its mechanical execution
this adze offers evidence of considerable skill on
the part of the Aztec lapidary, the polish equalling that
of modern workers. In the fact that a large piece, which
must apparently have weighed at least two pounds, has
evidently been cut out of this implement by some one of
its Indian owners, we can see a proof of the talismanic
power ascribed to jadeite in Aztec times, for there can be
little doubt that nothing less than a belief in the great
virtue of jadeite coupled with the rarity of the material
could have induced the mutilation of what must have been
regarded in its time as a remarkable work of art.<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>The source of the prehistoric jade (nephrite and
jadeite) found in Europe, and also of that worked into
ornaments by the Indians before the Spanish Conquest
of America, was long the subject of contention among
mineralogists and archæologists. In Germany this question
was denominated the <i>Nephritfrage</i>, and the most
notable contribution to the discussion was the great scien<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>tific
and scholarly work issued by Heinrich Fischer.<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>
His conclusion was that as there was no evidence of the
existence of these minerals outside of a few localities in
Asia, the European and American supply must have been
brought to these parts of the world from Asia, and that
hence the presence of these jade artefacts in America
clearly pointed to commercial intercourse at an early
period between the American continent and Asia, and
might be regarded as offering a strong argument in
favor of an Asiatic origin for an American civilization.
According to this theory the prehistoric jade objects
found in Europe must have had a similar source, and
would constitute a proof of the existence of traffic with
remote points in Asia at a date long previous to that
commonly accepted.</p>

<p>This view was strongly opposed by Prof. A. B. Meyer,
of Dresden, and recent discoveries have effectively disproved
the theory in the case of Europe at least, for
nephrite has been found there <i>in situ</i> in several places.
The largest mass of this material that has been taken
from a European deposit is that found by the writer at
Jordansmühl in Silesia, in April, 1899, and which weighed
4704 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> The origin of American jade in the forms
of nephrite and jadeite has not yet been definitely determined,
but we have every reason to suppose that deposits
of these minerals will eventually be discovered in various
parts of the American continent, as they have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
been in Europe. Indeed, the existence of nephrite in
Alaska is already well attested.</p>

<p>The peculiar and characteristic qualities of these substances
have made them favorite materials for ornamental
objects from the earliest ages down to our own day,
and in almost all parts of the world. A most important
element contributing to the popularity of jade has been
its supposed possession of wonderful talismanic and
therapeutic virtues, and while the Western world has not
the same belief in these matters as the Eastern world,
a more or less definite appreciation of what jade still
signifies for many in the Orient, continues to exercise an
influence over both Americans and Europeans, making
objects of nephrite or jadeite highly prized everywhere
at the present time.</p>

<p>The term <i>chalchihuitl</i> was indifferently applied by
the ancient Mexicans to a number of green or greenish-white
stones; <i>quetzal chalchihuitl</i>, which was regarded as
the most precious variety, may perhaps have more exclusively
denoted jadeite. This is somewhat indefinitely
described by Sahagun as being “white, with much transparency,
and with a slight greenish tinge, something like
jasper.” Of eight ornamental objects of green stone
examined some years ago by the writer, four were of
jadeite, one of serpentine, another of green quartz, and
the remaining two of a mixture of white feldspar and
green hornblende. An inferior kind of <i>chalchihuitl</i>, said
by Sahagun to have come from quarries in the vicinity of
Tecalco, appears to have been identical with the so-called
“Mexican onyx” which is found in veins in that place
and is an aragonite stalagmite. This material, from
which figures, ornaments and beads were made by the
ancient Mexicans, is to-day greatly valued as an ornamental
stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>The greater number of ancient Mexican jadeite beads
appear to have been rounded pebbles of this material,
assorted as to size and drilled for use in making necklaces.
Other green stones used at this time in Mexico
were green jasper, green plasma, serpentine and also the
“Tecalco onyx” or “marble” above mentioned. In many
cases these substances are of such rich green that they
might easily be mistaken for jadeite by those who lacked
the tests or the experience at the command of modern
mineralogists. Should jadeite ever be found <i lang="la">in situ</i> in
Mexico, it seems probable that the discovery will be made
in the State of Oaxaca, whence came the finest ancient
specimens, including the splendid votive adze. Moreover,
one of the few materials by which jadeite can be worked
is furnished by the streams of this region, whence have
been taken several rolled pebbles which the writer has
identified as yellow and blue corundum, the quality being
equal to that of specimens from Ceylon.<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>Gesner describes one of the lip ornaments worn by
the aborigines of South America in the following words:<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A green stone or gem which the inhabitants of the West Indies
use. They pierce their lips and insert this stone so that the thicker part
adheres to the hole and the rest protrudes. We might call these ornaments
<i>oripenduli</i> [mouth-pendants]. This stone was given me by a
learned Piedmontese, Johannes Ferrerius, and he wrote of it as follows:
“I send a cylindrical green stone, as long as a man’s middle finger, and
having at one extremity two ridges. It is stated that the Brazilians of
high rank wore these, from their youth, in their pierced lips; one or
more being worn according to the dignity of the wearer. While eating,
or whenever they so wish for any other reason, these ornaments are
removed from the lips.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>Similar ornaments, made of a green quartz and of beryl,
are in the Kunz collection in the Field Museum of
Chicago.</p>

<p>The reason for these strange mutilations, which often
cause serious discomfort to those who practice them, is
not at all easy to determine. Some have conjectured that
by the insertion of bright, colored objects in the ears,
nose and lips, members of the same tribe were enabled
to recognize each other at a distance; each tribe having
selected a particular color. However, although certain
local preferences are shown in the matter of color or
material, there is no hard and fast rule in this matter, and
frequently neighboring tribes will employ stones or shells
of the same or similar hue and appearance. Others find
in this custom a religious significance and suppose that
the mutilation represents a form of sacrifice to the spirits,
good or bad, who must be rendered favorable to man by
some act on his part showing his unconditional submission
to them. Originating in this way the idea of adornment
was a secondary impulse. It is a fact that ancient
peoples regarded the wearing of ear-rings as a badge
of slavery, and, according to a Rabbinical legend, Eve’s
ears were pierced as a punishment for her disobedience,
when she was driven from the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>A curious theory was advanced by Knopf.<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> He
calls attention to the habit children have of thrusting
small bright objects into their noses and ears, and suggests
that this indicates a natural propensity which,
coupled with the early-developed love of adornment, induced
primitive man to affix ornamental objects on or in
the nose, ear, or mouth. There may be more in this
than we are willing to admit, but on the whole it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
most probable that ceremonial and religious considerations
gave rise to the custom.</p>

<p>One of the largest masses of sculptured Chinese jade
is in the collection of T. B. Walker, Esq., of Minneapolis.
This shows a jade mountain, with groups of figures artistically
placed at its base, and winding pathways up to its
summit. On the face of the rock is inscribed in beautiful
Chinese characters the Epidendron Pavilion Essay of
Wang Hi-che, a masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy.</p>

<p>An enormous mass of New Zealand jade (punamu,
“green stone”) weighing 7000 pounds, found in South
Island in 1902, is to be seen in the Museum of Natural
History, New York; it was secured by the writer and was
donated to the Museum by the late J. Pierpont Morgan.
This is the largest mass of jade known, or of which
we have any record. On it is placed a remarkable and, in
its own peculiar way, an artistic decoration, serving as
a type of old Maori life, and at the same time designating
the geographic source of the jade in a striking and unmistakable
manner calculated to appeal to the least intelligent
visitor. This is a statue of a Maori warrior of the
old days, executing a war dance, characteristics of which
were a distortion of the features and a thrusting out of
the tongue intended to express defiance and contempt of
the enemy; the time or cadence of the dance was marked
by slapping the thigh with the flat of the left hand. This
figure was executed from life by Sigurd Neandross;
indeed it was actually cast from the model, so that there
can be no doubt as to its fidelity.</p>

<p>Rock-crystal is included among the various objects
used as fetiches by the Cherokee Indians. This stone is
believed to have great power to give aid in hunting and
also in divining. One owner of such a crystal kept his
magic stone wrapped up in buckskin and hid it in a sacred
cave; at stated intervals he would take it out of its re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>pository
and “feed” it by rubbing over it the blood of
a deer. This goes to prove that the stone, as a fetich, was
considered to be a living entity and as such to require
nourishment.<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>Precious stones have been everywhere regarded as
especially appropriate offerings at the shrine of a
divinity, for the worshipper naturally thought that what
was most valuable and beautiful in his eyes must also be
most pleasing to the divinity he worshipped. However,
we rarely find the usage which was remarked by Francisco
Lopez de Gomara among the Indians of New
Granada about the time of the Spanish Conquest.<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>
These natives “burned gold and emeralds” before the
images of the sun and moon, which were regarded as the
highest divinities. Certainly to use precious stones for
a “burnt offering” was an original and curious idea,
although we have abundant proof that pearls were offered
in this way by the mound-builders of the Mississippi
Valley. In this case great quantities of pearls were
burned at the obsequies of the chiefs of the tribes, or at
those of any one belonging to the family of a chief.</p>

<p>In ancient Mexico the lapidaries adored the four following
divinities as their tutelary gods: Chiconaui Itzcuintli
(“nine dogs”), Naualpilli (“noble necromancer”),
Macuilcalli (“five horses”), and Cintectl (“the
god of harvest”). A festival was celebrated in honor
of the three last-named divinities when the zodiacal sign
called <i>chiconaui itzcuintli</i> was in the ascendant. A
feminine divinity represented this sign and to her was
attributed the invention of the garments and the orna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>ments
worn by women. The four gods of the lapidaries
were looked upon as the discoverers and teachers of the
art of cutting precious stones and of piercing and polishing
them, as well as of the making of labrets and earflaps
of obsidian, rock-crystal, or amber. They also were
the inventors of necklaces and bracelets.<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>The stones worn by Chinese mandarins as a designation
of their rank were undoubtedly determined originally
by religious or ceremonial considerations. They are
as follows; it will be noticed that red stones are given the
preference:</p>

<p>The knowledge of classical mythology was so slight
among the ecclesiastics of the Middle Ages that some very
queer attributions of the subjects engraved on Greek
and Roman gems were made during this period. A
reliquary containing a tooth of the Apostle Peter, preserved
in the Cathedral of Troyes, was set with antique
gems which had been plundered by French and Venetian
crusaders from the treasure-house of the Greek Emperor
in Constantinople, when that city was sacked in 1204
during the Fourth Crusade. Among these gems was one
representing Leda and the Swan—certainly a curious
subject for the adornment of a Christian reliquary. Another
Greek or Roman gem, long preserved in a church,
was furnished by its Christian owners with an inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
indicating that the figure engraved upon it was that of
St. Michael, while in reality it was a representation of
the god Mercury. Still another gem was provided with
an inscription signifying that the subject was the temptation
of Mother Eve in the Garden of Eden, but the Greek
gem engraver’s intent had been to carve the figures of
Zeus and Athena, standing before an olive tree, a design
which appears on some Athenian coins; at the feet of the
divinities appears a serpent. In a similar way the grain-measure
crowning the head of Jupiter-Serapis led to the
attribution of a gem so engraved to the patriarch
Joseph.<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>An engraved amethyst bearing the figure of a little
Cupid is said to have been worn in a ring by St. Valentine.
While this may be somewhat doubtful, it is by no
means impossible, for many pagan gems were worn by
pious Christians, who reconciled their consciences to the
use of these beautiful but scarcely religious ornaments
by giving to the pagan symbols a Christian meaning.
Certainly, in view of the time-honored customs connected
with St. Valentine’s Day, there seems something
peculiarly appropriate in the design of the ring supposed
to have been worn by St. Valentine.</p>

<p>That precious stones had sense and feeling was quite
generally believed in medieval times, and a legend told of
St. Martial illustrates this idea. The gloves worn by this
saint were studded with precious stones, and when on a
certain occasion a sacrilegious act was committed in his
presence, the gems, horrified at the sight, sprang out of
their settings and fell to the ground before the eyes of the
onlookers.</p>

<p>The St. Sylvester or St. James stone is a banded
agate in two colors, the one dark and the other light,
with a cat’s-eye effect so that both colors are equally
visible. The light side represents
the old year, with
its known occurrences, and
the opaque side represents
the new year, which is dark
like futurity. This is a
typical stone for a New
Year’s present or for one
born on St. Sylvester’s Day,
the last day of the year.
The popular tradition is that
the member of a family or a
household who is last to
arise on that day will be
the last to arise all the year
around.</p>

<p>The famous “Sacro Catino”
preserved in Genoa
was long believed to be made
of a single immense emerald,
but careful investigation
proved that it was of no more
valuable material than green
glass. A legend still current
in the early part of the
sixteenth century represented
this cup, or dish, as
having been used by Christ at the Last Supper, and stated
that it was one of the utensils which King Herod ordered
to be brought from Galilee to Jerusalem for the celebration
of the paschal feast; but his purpose having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
changed by Divine Providence, he made other use
of it.<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>A queer story has been told regarding the Genoese
emerald. At one time when the government was hard
pressed for money, the Sacro Catino was offered to a
rich Jew of Metz as pledge for a loan of 100,000 crowns.
He was loath to take it, as he probably recognized its
spurious character, and when his Christian clients forced
him to accept it under threats of dire vengeance in case
of refusal, he protested that they were taking a base
advantage of the unpopularity of his faith, since they
could not find a Christian who would make the loan.
However, when some years later the Genoese were ready
to redeem this precious relic, they were much puzzled to
learn that a half-dozen different persons claimed to have
it in their possession, the fact being that the Jew had
fabricated a number of copies which he had succeeded in
pawning for large sums, assuring the lender in each case
that the redemption of the pledge was certain.</p>

<p>Among the celebrated emeralds noted by George
Agricola<a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> (1490-1555) was a large one preserved in a
monastery near Lyons, France. This is also mentioned
by Gesner, who states that it was shaped as a dish, or
shallow cup, and was held to be the Holy Grail, like its
rival at Genoa.<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> Another of Agricola’s emeralds was
somewhat smaller, but nevertheless measured nine inches
in diameter and was in the chapel of St. Wenceslaus, at
Prague; this may have been a chrysoprase, as at the
present day many fine specimens of this stone can be seen
in St. Wenceslaus, where the walls are inlaid with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
golden green gem-stone. Still another, larger than the
last named, was set in the gold monstrance in Magdeburg,
and was believed to have been the handle of Emperor Otho
I’s knife, since it was perforated. Possibly, however, the
emerald, if genuine, was an Oriental stone, for it was
customary to pierce rubies, sapphires, emeralds, etc., in
the East so as to string them for necklaces or attach them
as pendants to a jewel.</p>

<p>In the convent-church of St. Stephan, in Persian
Armenia, erected about the middle of the seventeenth
century, it is related by the French traveller Tavernier
that there was preserved a cross said to be made out
of the basin in which Christ washed the feet of the
Apostles. Set in this cross was a white stone, and the
priests asserted that when the cross was laid upon the
body of one seriously ill, this stone would turn black if
he were about to die, but would regain its white hue after
his death.<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></p>

<p>No jewelled sacred image has been the object of
greater reverence than has been accorded to the rude
little wooden carving popularly known as the “Sacro
Bambino” or “Sacred Baby,” in the old church of Ara
Coeli in Rome. This figure was carved, in 1847, by a
monk, out of a piece of olive-wood from one of the ancient
trees growing on the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem.
The carving was executed in the Holy Land and was sent
thence to Italy, and although the ship bearing it was shipwrecked,
this precious freight was miraculously preserved
and is supposed to have been conveyed to its destination
in some mysterious way. The reverence of the
thousands of pilgrims who in the course of time have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
gazed with veneration upon this quaint and curious work
of art, has found expression in the bestowal of a wealth
of gems and jewels, including necklaces, brooches, rings,
etc., with which the silken dress of the image is studded.
A crown of gold adorned with precious stones rests upon
the head of the olive-wood figure, which is jealously
guarded by the priests and only shown to the faithful as a
particular favor, except on the occasion of certain religious
festivals.</p>

<p>One of the most renowned emeralds in the world surmounted
the elaborately jewelled imperial crown that was
placed upon the head of the venerated image of the Virgen
del Sagrario in the Cathedral of Toledo. This emerald, of
a rich green color, was cut as a perfect sphere and
measured about 40 millimetres, or 1½ inches, in diameter.
The crown itself was the work of the Toledan goldsmith,
Don Diego Alejo de Montoya, who began his task in 1574
and devoted twelve years to its completion. It is described
as being of almost pure gold and executed in the
Renaissance style. Curiously chased in arabesque designs
and enamelled in various colors, the framework of
the crown served as a magnificent background for the
gems constituting its adornment, which comprised
rubies, emeralds, and Oriental pearls; a row of angels
and cherubs sustained the arches which bore at their
summit the allegorical figures of Faith, Hope, and
Charity; upon that representing Faith rested the splendid
emerald. This precious ornament was still preserved
in the Cathedral in 1865, but was so carelessly guarded
that it was stolen in 1869.<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></p>

<p>If we are to believe the following anecdote, the em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>erald
disappeared at an earlier date: It is said that in
1809, during the French occupation of Spain, Marshal
Junot visited this cathedral, and the emerald was pointed
out to him as one of the chief glories of the shrine. As
soon as the marshal’s covetous glance rested upon the
gem, he plucked it from its setting, remarking, coolly, to
the astonished and horrified bystanders, “This belongs
to me.” Then, smiling and bowing, he left the cathedral
with the emerald safely ensconced in his waistcoat pocket.
Later, it was replaced by an imitation in glass.</p>

<p>The famous collection of jewels gathered together
in the treasury of the Santa Casa, at Loreto, Italy, was
plundered during the French occupation in 1797, and all
trace of most of the magnificent ornaments has been lost.
These represented the gifts of many crowned heads and
titled personages; among the former was the unfortunate
Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I, who donated a
golden heart-shaped jewel with the words “Jesus
Maria” incrusted in diamonds. This jewel is described
as being “as big as both a man’s hands, opened onto two
leaves, on one of which was the figure of the Blessed
Virgin and on the other a portrait of the queen herself.”<a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>
Of the many rich vestments for decorating the statue of
the Virgin in the sanctuary, the most splendid was the
gift of the Infanta Isabel of Flanders, and was valued
at 40,000 crowns. In a seventeenth-century account by
an English traveller it is thus described:<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Its set thick with six rows of diamonds downe before, to the number
of three thousand, and its all wrought over with a kinde of embroidery
of little pearle set thick everywhere within the flowers with
great round pearle, to the number twenty thousand pearles in all.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>The same writer tells us the niche in which the statue
was placed was bordered with a row of precious stones of
great number, size, and value, the colors being so varied
that this bordering formed “a rich Iris of several
colors.” There is also said to have been a great pearl,
set in gold, and engraved with the image of the Virgin
and Child.<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> It seems probable that this was a jewel
made of a baroque pearl, or pearls, completed by enamel-work
so as to represent the sacred figures.</p>

<p>The pectoral cross worn in solemn processions by the
prior of the monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial was
adorned with eight perfect emeralds, five diamonds, and
five pearls. From it hung a splendid pear-shaped pearl,
the gift of Philip II in 1595, and one of the finest of those
acquired by this monarch. In 1740 the cross was valued
at 50,000 crowns, Philip’s great pearl not being included
in this valuation.<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>The monastery of Streoneshalh, later Whitby Abbey,
was founded about 656 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> by Oswy, King of Northumbria,
in fulfilment of a vow made before his victory over
the pagan king Penda, at the battle of Winwidfield,
fought in November, 654. St. Hilda was made abbess of
this monastery, and Oswy’s daughter Aelfleda took the
veil and eventually, in 680, succeeded Hilda as abbess;
she died in 713.<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> Tradition relates that at this early
date crosses and rosaries were made for the inmates of
the monastery from the jet found in the neighborhood.
The “Whitby jet,” so popular and fashionable in the
eighteenth century, was largely derived from the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
source, and since then has had several revivals, until
replaced by black-stained chalcedony, the so-called onyx,
and, later still, by steel carved with glass and glass itself.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century jet was popularly called
“black amber,” and Cardano states that in his time
beads of this material were made up into rosaries. He
also says that curious figures made of jet were brought
from Spain to Italy.<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>Many are unaware of the fact that a number of ornamental
objects made of nephrite and jadeite—unquestionably
of European origin—are to be seen in the quiet
little town of Perugia. These objects, collected principally
in central and southern Italy, constitute the Belucci
Collection, in that city. This collection also contains
other specimens of worked jadeite, which must have been
brought to Europe at the time of the Spanish conquest
of Mexico and Peru. A very interesting example shows
us the utilization of a pagan celt to form a Christian
emblem. By the removal of a rectangular piece from
each of the four corners of the jadeite celt, a perfect cross
has been made, the back and front of which still offer the
original polish given to the material centuries ago by
the native American worker. The superstitious belief
propagated in Europe by the returning Spanish sailors,
very probably an invention of their own to enhance the
value of their jade and jadeite, that these minerals were
worn by the natives as a cure for diseases of the kidneys,
whence the name <i>lapis nephriticus</i>, rendered the material
exceptionally precious in the eyes of many, and quite
possibly it may have been thought that, by transforming
this object into the sacred form of the cross, a talisman
would be produced that would not only effect the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
cure of a special disease, but would also by its superior
virtue guard the wearer from harm and danger of all
kinds. Here may also be seen some celts of European
jade sewed up in little bags to be worn on the loins.</p>

<p>Certain curious amulets called <i>magatama</i> (crooked
jewels) have been found in Japanese graves of the iron
age;<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> they are formed of various materials, among
others of steatite, jasper, carnelian, agate, rock crystal,
chrysoprase and nephrite (jade). In the shell heaps of
a period preceding the iron age, the magatama are frequently
made of horn, or of boar’s or wolf’s teeth, and
their peculiar form, which is variously explained as a
symbol, may have been conditioned by the shape of the
materials originally used. The <i>magatama</i> were evidently
regarded as amulets. “They are generally perforated
at the thick end, and were worn on a string, together with
beads and bugles of the same material.” These peculiar
ornaments were used to adorn the statues of the gods and
were also employed as imperial insignia and distinctive
marks of high rank. At the present day they are numbered
among the three emblems of sovereignty in Japan.</p>

<p>A green and a red magatama are combined in the
national emblem of Korea and a similar figure is used
in China to symbolize the union of the masculine and
feminine principles (Yang and Yin) in nature. Dr. Baelz
believes that the swastika emblem, encountered in so
many different parts of the world, belongs to the same
order of ideas.</p>

<p>The Bghai tribes of Burma have many superstitions
in regard to stones, such as garnets, rock-crystal, chalcedony,
carnelian, agate, onyx and others of less value,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
their repute not depending entirely or principally upon
their quality as gem-stones. In almost every household
is installed a stone fetish, and blood offerings are on
occasion made to this. A question as to the reason for
this offering elicited the following reply: “If we do not
give it blood to eat it will eat us.” A common belief
was that spirits good or bad dwelt in the stones, and
in case a great misfortune befell a family, this was sometimes
laid to the charge of such a spirit. The father of
a family having died, his widow commanded her son to
throw away their magic stone. This he did, but the spirit
was not to be denied, for shortly afterward this very stone
was found to have returned to its accustomed place, and
had even brought two companion stones with it!<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p>Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, who travelled in the East
during the years 1403-1406, gives a description of a slab
of stone bearing the outlines of a “natural picture,” and
placed in the church of St. Sophia, in Constantinople:<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the wall, on the left-hand side, there is a very large white slab,
on which, among many other figures, was drawn, very naturally, without
any human artifice of sculpture or painting, the most sacred and
blessed Virgin Mary, with our Lord Jesus Christ in her most holy arms,
with his most glorious forerunner, St. John the Baptist, on one side.
These images, as I said before, are not drawn or painted with any color,
or inlaid, but the stone itself gave birth to this picture, with its veins,
which may be clearly seen; and they say that when this stone was cut,
to be placed in this most holy place, the workman saw these most
wonderful and fortunate images on it, and, as this church was the most
important one in the city, that stone was deposited in it. The said
images appear as if they were in the clouds of heaven, and as if there
was a thin veil before them.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p>Many other examples of these “natural gems” are
noted by early writers. Among them was an agate gem
in the treasury of the Basilica of St. Mark, in Venice.
Upon this gem appeared the head of a king, adorned with
a diadem, the whole design being figured naturally by the
veining of the agate, and not owing anything to artifice.
In the same city, upon a column in the church of San
Georgio Maggiore, could be seen the likeness of Our
Lord, hanging from the Cross.<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></p>

<p>Such stones, with peculiar markings indicating the
form of human heads and figures, were regarded as the
work of higher powers.</p>

<p>Another remarkable example is described by Kircher
as follows:<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Rome, in the Chapel of the Sacred Virgin, near the organ to
the right hand of those who enter the Church of St. Peter, an image
may be seen in which the Blessed Virgin of Loreto is so artistically
depicted by Nature that it appears to be the work of an artist’s hand.
She is attired in a triple garment, divided by a zone, and holds in her
arms the child, who is distinguished by a crown, as is the mother.
Around may be seen the figures of angels.</p></blockquote>

<p>The red spots upon the bloodstone were said in Christian
legend to represent the blood of Christ. This idea
has been beautifully utilized in some gems cut from this
stone, whereon the thorn-crowned head of Christ is so
placed that the red spots of the bloodstone figure the
drops of blood trickling down the hair and face of the
Saviour. Such a gem might well be looked upon as a
Christian amulet and one that could be reverently worn
by any believer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>The ignorance in the Middle Ages of the art of gem-engraving
often induced the belief that engraved stones
were the work of nature. A striking instance of this was
the celebrated stone over the figure of the Mother of
Jesus, on the tomb of St. Elizabeth of Marburg. On
this gem appeared two heads touching each other, and it
was, according to tradition, not a work of art, but a freak
of the sculptress Nature. An oft-repeated legend tells
us that a former Elector of Mainz offered the whole district
of Amöneberg for this costly stone, which robber
hands removed at Cassel. It is in reality a fine onyx engraved
with the heads of Castor and Pollux.<a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

<p>We might be disposed to regard rather sceptically
the tales regarding wonderful stones bearing the image
of Christ, or that of the Virgin Mary, and we may be inclined
to believe that the old accounts are exaggerated
or distorted by the pious imaginations of the writers.
Nevertheless, in our own time we have a well-attested
case of the discovery of such a stone.</p>

<p>In 1880, while visiting the village of Oberammergau,
Bavaria, to witness the Passion Play, Mrs. Eugenia
Jones-Bacon, of Atlanta, Georgia, found on Mount Kopfel,
which overlooks the village, a small stone composed
of chert and limestone, and having on its surface excrescences
so disposed that, when the stone was held at a
certain angle, the shadows cast by them formed a striking
likeness of the head of Christ as depicted in Christian
art. This peculiar freak specimen has been carefully
examined by experts and has been pronounced to be
entirely a work of nature. The mineralogist is not disposed
to see here anything more than coincidence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
yet the most sceptical cannot fail to be impressed by the
fact that such a stone was found at the time and place of
the Passion Play. As Max Müller said, in commenting
on this strange discovery: “The chapter of accidents is
much larger than we imagine,” and the present writer
feels disposed to add that it is remarkable how often
we find what we are looking for, especially if we are
only looking or thinking of one object or subject.</p>

<p>The religious symbolism of the diamond was a
favorite theme with the thirteenth century “lapidaria,”
or rhymed treatises on precious stones. Just as it could
only be discovered by night—an old fancy—so was the
Incarnation a hidden mystery; it gave forth a great light,
just as Jesus illumined the depths of Hades when he descended
thither; it was unconquerably hard, and who can
resist the might of God?<a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>The mediæval Italians who were fond of seeking some
hidden and significant meaning in the names of precious
stones, in the case of the diamond (diamante), read the
phrase <i lang="it">amante di Dio</i>, or “lover of God.”<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> This was
a reason for regarding the brilliant gem as a sacred stone
and one especially suitable for religious use.</p>

<p>The Rosicrucians, who sought to combine pagan with
Christian types and figures, saw in the amethyst and
the amethystine color a symbol of the divine male sacrifice,
since the stone and the color were typical of love,
truth, passion, suffering, and hope. The love of Christ
led him to make the supreme sacrifice and suffer the
agony of the Cross, and the Crucifixion was followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
the Resurrection, whence came the hope of mankind to
enjoy eternal happiness in heaven.</p>

<p>The chiastolite, or macle, shows the representation of
a cross on its surface, this effect being produced by the
regular arrangement of carbonaceous impurities along
the axes of the crystal. The name signifies a marking
resembling the Greek letter Χ (chi). This marking is
often very striking in appearance, and the crystal was
naturally regarded as having a mystical and religious
significance. It was said to stanch the flow of blood from
any part of the body if worn so as to touch the skin, and
it was also believed to increase the secretion of milk.
All kinds of fevers were cured by this mineral if it were
worn suspended from the neck, and the divine symbol it
bore served to drive away evil spirits from the neighborhood
of the wearer.</p>

<p>This very interesting mineral occurs very frequently
in mica schists. When found, it appears about the thickness
of a small finger, tapering slightly at each edge. If
broken near one end, it often shows a white cross with a
veined outline of black, making a distinct cross with black
markings. The crystals frequently measure from two to
four inches in length, and are found in Massachusetts,
California, and other places. If small segments are
broken off, it will be found that the black outline will
become stronger, and the white less marked, until finally
a black cross will appear, with white markings. The
white material is the result of two white wedges pushed
point onward until the ends meet, the narrow end of one
wedge being crossed by the broad end of the second
wedge, and the black filling in the balance of the square.
No two of these square crosses can thus ever be exactly
alike, and, when polished, the crystals naturally form an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
interesting stone that was known as <i>lapis crucifer</i>, or
cross-stone by the ancients.</p>

<div class="caption">STAUROLITE CRYSTALS (FAIRY STONES).<br />
<small>Patrick County, Virginia.</small></div>
</div>

<p>The peculiar form of the mineral known as staurolite
(from the Greek σταυρός cross) is due to the twinning of
two crystals at right angles. In Cronstedt’s treatise on
mineralogy, published in Stockholm in 1758, we are told
that the staurolite was sometimes called Baseler Taufstein
(baptismal-stone) or <i>lapis crucifer</i>, the former name
being used in Basel, where the stone was employed as an
amulet at baptisms. However, the <i>lapis crucifer</i> of De
Boot appears from his description to have been the chiastolite.
In Brittany these twin crystals were worn as
charms, and local legends state that they had dropped
from the heavens.</p>

<p>Fine crystals of staurolite have been found in Patrick
County, Virginia, and there is said to be a beautiful local
legend in regard to their origin. Near where they are
found there wells up a spring of limpid water, and the
story goes that one day, long, long ago, when the fairies
were dancing and playing around this spring, an elfin
messenger winged his way through the air and alighted
among them. He bore to them the sad tidings of the
crucifixion of Christ in a far-off city. So mournful was
his recital of the sufferings of the Saviour that the fairies
burst into tears, and these fairy tear-drops, as they fell
to earth, crystallized into the form of the cross. These
natural crosses are in great demand as charms, and ex-President
Roosevelt is said to wear one of them mounted
as a watch-charm.</p>

<p>There has been found in the southern part of New
Mexico, and in northern Mexico, a blue variety of calamine,
a hydrous silicate of zinc, colored blue by an admixture
of copper. This stone has been cut into gem form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
and has been sold to a certain extent as a cheap gem. It
is translucent and is sometimes veined with white wavy
lines. The Mexican Indians employed in the mines often
set up a cross and a candle near where they are working,
so that they may pay their devotions at this improvised
shrine. In Sonora and Western Chihuahua the Indians
frequently place a piece of the stone to which we have
alluded alongside the cross. They may be attracted by
its beautiful blue color, or they may believe that it is a
turquoise, although it does not resemble this latter stone,
which is more opaque, of a different shade of blue and
of a different composition.</p>

<p>In some epitaphs the hope of the resurrection finds
expression in likening the body enclosed in its narrow
coffin to a precious jewel in its casket. The following
lines from a tombstone erected in 1655 to the memory
of Mary Courtney, at Fowell, Cornwall, England, give a
good example of this class of inscription:<a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></p>

died in 1641 and the second in 1658. The bereaved hus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>band

<p>The Christian symbolism of colors has in many cases
determined the use of certain colored gems for religious
ornaments, and therefore the following summary of their
principal significance is of interest here:<a id="FNanchor_408_408" href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">White</span> is regarded as the first of the canonical colors, and as
emblematic of purity, innocence, virginity, faith, life, and light. For
this reason it is used in the ceremonies of Easter and Christmas, as in
those of the Circumcision and Epiphany of Our Lord. As the color of
virginity it is especially appropriate for the festival of the Virgin
Mary, and as that of faith not sealed with blood, for the festivals of
the saints who were not martyred. The heavenly host of angels and
saints wear white robes, and in pictures of the Assumption of the
Virgin she is frequently clad in white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red</span> is used at the feasts of the Exaltation and Invention of the
Cross, at Pentecost, and at the Feast of Martyrs. It suggests and
symbolizes suffering and martyrdom for the faith, and the supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. Divine love and majesty are
also typified by this color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue</span> is an emblem of the celestial regions and of the celestial
virtues. Nevertheless, as this is not one of the five canonical colors, it is
not employed for the decoration of churches or for ecclesiastical vestments.
In Christian art, however, the Virgin and the saints and angels
are often robed in blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow</span> of a golden hue is emblematic of God’s goodness and of
faith and good works, but it is not a canonical color. A dull yellow,
however, has the opposite signification, and is a type of treachery and
envy. Hence Judas is garbed in yellow of a dull hue, and heretics wore
garments of this shade when they were condemned to the stake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green</span> is the canonical color for use on Sundays, week-days, and
ordinary festivals. Hope and joy and the bright promises of youth
are signified by green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violet</span>, another canonical color, is appropriate for use on Septuagesima
and Quinquagesima Sundays, during Lent, and on Advent
Sunday. The chastening and purifying effects of suffering find expression
in this color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black</span>, also a canonical color, is a symbol of death and of the
mourning and sorrow inspired by death. Therefore it is only used in
the Church on Good Friday, to symbolize the sorrow and despair of the
Christian community at the death of Christ, a sorrow soon to be turned
to joy by His glorious resurrection.</p></blockquote>

<small>On the High-Priest’s Breastplate</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">VERY early, and very naturally, the religious nature
of man led to the use of precious stones in connection
with worship—the most valuable and elegant objects
being chosen for sacred purposes. Of this mode of thought,
we have a striking instance in the accounts given, in the
book of Exodus, of the breastplate of the High-priest,
and the gems contributed for the tabernacle by the Israelites
in the wilderness. Another religious association of
such objects is their use to symbolize ideas of the Divine
glory, as illustrated in the visions of the prophet Ezekiel
and in the description of the New Jerusalem in the book
of Revelation. Apart from such legitimate uses, however,
gems have become associated with all manner of religious
fancies and superstitions, traces of which appear in the
Talmud, the Koran, and similar writings; they have also
been dedicated to various heathen deities. Even in modern
times, some trace of the same ideas remains in the
ecclesiastical jewelry and its supposed symbolism.</p>

<p>In the vision of Ezekiel i, 26, and in a brief allusion to
the similar appearance of the God of Israel in Exodus
xxiv, the throne of Jehovah, or the pavement beneath
his feet, is compared to a sapphire, and the Apostle John,
in the Apocalypse, describes the Great White Throne as
surrounded by a rainbow like an emerald.</p>

<p>The Rabbinical writings, instead of the simple grandeur
of these biblical comparisons, give us many fanciful
ideas. The stones of the breastplate are here represented
as sacred to twelve mighty angels who guard the gates of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Paradise, and wondrous tales are told of the luminous
gems in the tent of Abraham and the ark of Noah. Mohammedan
legend represents the different heavens as
composed of different precious stones, and in the Middle
Ages these religious ideas became interwoven with a host
of astrological, alchemistic, and medical superstitions.</p>

<p>The following is the description of the breastplate
given in Exodus (xxviii, 15-30):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue,
and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen shalt thou
make it.</p>

<p>Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length
thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.</p>

<p>And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones:
the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall
be the first row.</p>

<p>And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
diamond.</p>

<p>And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.</p>

<p>And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper; they shall
be set in gold in their enclosings.</p>

<p>Of the miraculous quality of the stones worn by the
high-priest, the Jewish historian Josephus (37-95 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>)
says:<a id="FNanchor_409_409" href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the stones which the high-priest wore (these were sardonyxes,
and I hold it superfluous to describe their nature, since it is
known to all), there emanated a light, as often as God was present at
the sacrifices; that which was worn on the right shoulder instead of a
clasp emitting a radiance sufficient to give light even to those far
away, although the stone previously lacked this splendor. And certainly
this in itself merits the wonder of all those who do not, out of
contempt for religion, allow themselves to be led away by a pretence
of wisdom. However, I am about to relate something still more
wonderful, namely, that God announced victory in battle by means of
the twelve stones worn by the high-priest on his breast, set in the
pectoral. For such a splendor shone from them when the army was
not yet in motion, that all the people knew that God himself was
present to aid them. For this reason the Greeks who reverence our
solemnities, since they could not deny this, called the pectoral λόγιον
or oracle. However, the pectoral and the onyxes ceased to emit this
radiance two hundred years before the time when I write this, because
God was displeased at the transgressions of the Law.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>This writer, who must have seen the high-priest wearing
his elaborate vestments, says that the breastplate was
adorned “with twelve stones of exceptional size and
beauty, a decoration not easily to be acquired, on account
of its enormous value.”<a id="FNanchor_410_410" href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> However these gems were not
merely rare and costly; they also possessed wonderful
and miraculous powers. Writing about 400 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, St. Epiphanius,
Bishop of Constantia, tells of a marvellous
<i>adamas</i> which was worn on the breast of the high-priest,
who showed himself to the people, arrayed in all his gorgeous
vestments, at the feasts of Pascha, Pentecost, and
Tabernacles. This adamas was termed the δήλωσις or
“Declaration,” because, by its appearance, it announced
to the people the fate that God had in store for them.
If the people were sinful and disobedient, the stone assumed
a dusky hue, which portended death by disease, or
else it became the color of blood, signifying that the
people would be slain by the sword. If, however, the
stone shone like the driven snow, then the people recognized
that they had not sinned, and hastened to celebrate
the festival.<a id="FNanchor_411_411" href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>There seems to be little doubt that this account is
nothing more than an elaboration and modification of
the passage in Josephus. Evidently the λόγιον (oracle)
of Josephus has become the δήλωσις (declaration).</p>

<p>When Moses wished to engrave on the stones of the
breastplate the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, he
is said to have had recourse to the miraculous <i>shamir</i>.
The names were first traced in ink on the stones, and the
shamir was then passed over them, the result being that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
the traced inscriptions became graven on the stones.
In proof of the magical character of this operation, no particles
of the gems were removed in the process.<a id="FNanchor_412_412" href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> The
name really designates “emery.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p>An argument against the use of especially rare and
costly stones in the decoration of the breastplate has
been found in its probable size.<a id="FNanchor_413_413" href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> We are told that when
folded it measured a span in each direction, and this
would indicate that its length and breadth were each
from eight to nine inches. In this case the stones themselves
might have measured two by two and a half inches,
and, in view of the number of characters required to
express some of the tribal names, these dimensions do not
seem excessive. It is highly improbable that in the time
of Moses precious stones like the ruby, the emerald, or
the sapphire would have been available in these dimensions.
The difficulty of engraving very hard stones with
the appliances at the command of the Hebrews of this
period must also be taken into consideration. As we shall
see, however, there is good reason to believe that after
the Babylonian Captivity a new breastplate was made,
and at that time it may have been easier to secure and
work precious stones of great value and a high degree
of hardness. We must also bear in mind that in those
periods perfection was not so great a requisite as rich
color.</p>

<p>In his commentary on Exodus xxviii, Cornelius à
Lapide (Cornelius Van den Steen) discusses the question
of the diamond in the high-priest’s breastplate. In the
first place, he notes that the diamond was very costly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
that a large stone would have been needed to bear the
name of Judah or that of any other tribe. He considers
that a stone of the requisite size would have cost a hundred
thousand gold crowns, and he asks, “Whence could
the poor Hebrews have obtained such a sum of money,
and where could they have found such a diamond?” He
proceeds to give still another reason for doubting that
the diamond was in the breastplate,—namely, that it
would have marked too great a distinction between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
tribes, the result being that the tribe to which the diamond
was assigned would have been puffed up with pride,
while the others would have been filled with hatred and
envy, “for the diamond is the Queen Gem of all the
gems.”<a id="FNanchor_414_414" href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></p>

<p>The use of the breastplate to reveal the guilt of an
offender is testified to in a Samaritan version of the book
of Joshua, which has been discovered by Dr. Moses
Gaster, chief rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews
in England. According to this version, Achan steals a
golden image from a heathen temple in Jericho. The
high-priest’s breastplate reveals his guilt, for the stones
lose their light and grow dim when his name is pronounced.</p>

<p>Many conjectures have been made as to the origin of
the breastplate with the mystic Urim and Thummim enclosed
within it. That an Egyptian origin should be
sought seems most probable. A breast-ornament worn
by the high-priest of Memphis, as figured in an Egyptian
relief, consists of twelve small balls, or crosses, intended
to represent Egyptian hieroglyphics. As it cannot be
determined that these figures were cut from precious
stones, the only definite connection with the Hebrew ornament
is the number of the figures; this suggests, but fails
to prove, a common origin. The monuments show that
the high-priest of Memphis wore this ornament as early
as the fourth Dynasty, or, approximately, 4000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_415_415" href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></p>

<p>Of the Urim and Thummim, the mysterious oracle of
the ancient Hebrews, St. Augustine (354-450 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>), after
acknowledging the great difficulty of interpreting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
meaning of the words and the character of the oracle,
adds that some believed the words to signify a single
stone which changed color according as the answer was
favorable or unfavorable, while the priest was entering
the sanctuary; still he thought it possible that merely
the letters of the words Urim and Thummin were inscribed
upon the breastplate.<a id="FNanchor_416_416" href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></p>

<p>After the capture of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,
the treasures of the temple were carried off to Rome,
and we learn from Josephus that the breastplate was deposited
in the Temple of Concord, which had been erected
by Vespasian. Here it is believed to have been at the
time of the sacking of Rome by the Vandals under Genseric,
in 455, although Rev. C. W. King thinks it is not
improbable that Alaric, king of the Visigoths, when he
sacked Rome in 410 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, might have secured this treasure.<a id="FNanchor_417_417" href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
However, the express statement of Procopius that
“the vessels of the Jews” were carried through the
streets of Constantinople, on the occasion of the Vandalic
triumph of Belisarius, in 534, may be taken as a confirmation
of the conjecture that the Vandals had secured
possession of the breastplate and its jewels.<a id="FNanchor_418_418" href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></p>

<p>It must, however, be carefully noted that Procopius
nowhere mentions the breastplate and that it need not
have been included among “the vessels of the Jews.” It
appears that this part of the spoils of Belisarius was
placed by Justinian (483-565) in the sacristy of the
church of St. Sophia. Some time later, the emperor is
said to have heard of the saying of a certain Jew to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
effect that, until the treasures of the Temple were restored
to Jerusalem, they would bring misfortune upon
any place where they might be kept.<a id="FNanchor_419_419" href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> If this story be
true, Justinian may have felt that the fate of Rome was
a lesson for him, and that Constantinople must be saved
from a like disaster. Moved by such considerations, he
is said to have sent the “sacred vessels” to Jerusalem,
and they were placed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>This brings us to the last two events which can be
even plausibly connected with the mystic twelve gems,—namely,
the capture and sack of Jerusalem by the Sassanian
Persian king, Khusrau II, in 615, and the overthrow
of the Sassanian Empire by the Mohammedan
Arabs, and the capture and sack of Ctesiphon, in 637.<a id="FNanchor_420_420" href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>
If we admit that Khusrau took the sacred relics of the
Temple with him to Persia, we may be reasonably sure
that they were included among the spoils secured by the
Arab conquerors, although King, who has ingeniously
endeavored to trace out the history of the breastplate
jewels after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, believes that
they may be still “buried in some unknown treasure-chamber
of one of the old Persian capitals.”</p>

<p>A fact which has generally been overlooked by those
who have embarked on the sea of conjecture relative to
the fate of the breastplate stones is that a large Jewish
contingent, numbering some twenty-six thousand men,
formed part of the force with which the Sassanian Persians
captured Jerusalem, and they might well lay claim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
to any Jewish vessels or jewels that may have been
secured by the conquerors. In this case, however, it is
still probable that these precious objects fell into the
hands of the Mohammedans who captured Jerusalem in
the same year in which they took Ctesiphon.</p>

<p>One circumstance which may have contributed to the
preservation of these gems in their original form after
they fell into the hands of the Romans is the fact that
each one was engraved with the name of one of the Jewish
tribes, the inscription being probably in the older form
of Hebrew writing, which was used in the coinage even
as late as the last revolt in 137 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Hence, recutting
would have been necessary to fit them for use as ornaments,
a process not easily accomplished, and involving
a great loss of size. We must also bear in mind that the
intrinsic value of the gems may not have been so great
as many suppose, since all of them were probably of the
less perfect forms of the precious and semi-precious
varieties. It is very likely that the enthusiastic statements
of Josephus in this connection were dictated by
national pride, or arose from the tendency to exaggeration
so common among the Oriental writers. Certainly,
if the breastplate known to Josephus was made not long
after the return of the Jews from the Babylonian Captivity,
their financial resources at the time of its fabrication
were quite restricted.</p>

<p>Admitting as a possibility that the Arabs may have
secured possession of the breastplate, how would they
have regarded it? The heroes of the Old Testament, and
especially Moses, were such sacred personalities in the
eyes of Mohammedans that this relic would have been as
precious for them as for us. However, the victorious
Arabs who overran the Sassanian Empire, although filled
with religious zeal, were no students of archæology, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
would have been quite unable to decipher the strange
characters engraved on the stones. They would most
probably have supposed them to be Persian characters,
and would, therefore, have valued these stones no higher
than others in the Persian treasure. This can serve as
an explanation of the fact that no allusion to the breastplate
with its adornment can be found in the works of
those Mohammedan writers, such as Tabari, who treat
of the overthrow of the Sassanian Empire. We may be
sure that the Persians themselves would have accorded
no special honor to objects connected with the Hebrew
religion, since their own Zoroastrian faith had no connection
with it.</p>

<p>In 628, not long before the date of the Arab invasion,
the most precious relic of Christendom, the cross discovered
by Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, and
believed to be the very cross on which Christ died, was
surrendered to the Greek Emperor Heraclius by Kobad
II, son of Khusrau II, on the conclusion of a treaty of
peace between the Eastern and Sassanian Empires.
This cross was one of the sacred objects borne away
to Persia from Jerusalem by Khusrau in 615 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> It is
said to have been guarded carefully through the influence
of Sira, Khusrau’s Christian wife. There is a bare
possibility that other objects of religious veneration,
taken from Jerusalem, may have been given up by the
Persians at the same time, and that the unique character
of the most important relic so overshadowed all
others that historians have failed to note the fact. The
cross was restored to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629, only
to fall into the hands of the Mohammedans when that city
was taken by the Arabs under Omar, in 637. Hence, if the
jewelled breastplate had also been surrendered by Kobad,
it would probably have shared the same fate.</p>

<p>We have here a wide field for conjecture,—but, unfortunately,
nothing more. Still, in the absence of any
definite and trustworthy information, there is a kind of
romantic interest in viewing the various possible relations
of the mystery surrounding the fate of the most
precious gems, historically at least, that have ever existed.
More especially is this interest justified in the
case of all who are disposed to prize gems and jewels
for their symbolic significance, for, as we have shown,
this significance, as far as concerns natal stones and the
spiritual interpretation of the qualities of the heart and
soul symbolized by the color and character of the principal
precious and semi-precious stones, has its root in
the veneration felt by early Christian writers, beginning
with the author of the Apocalypse, for the unforgotten
and unforgettable gems that were worn by the Hebrew
high-priest.</p>

<p>A rather ingenious utilization of the reputed
powers of Aaron’s breastplate comes to us in a book
printed in Portland, Maine.<a id="FNanchor_421_421" href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> The writer assumes that
the Urim and Thummim enclosed in the folds of the
breastplate consisted of twelve stones, duplicates of those
engraved with the names of the tribes, and so disposed
that, when they were shaken to and fro and then allowed
to come to rest, three of them would become visible
through an aperture in the ephod just beneath the rows
of set stones. The signification of the oracle is given by
the various combinations of color offered by the three
stones that reveal themselves; to each combination a
prearranged meaning is given. That anything of the
kind could have been true of the original Urim and Thummim
is scarcely worthy the trouble of refutation, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
practical result of this modern experiment is a clever
oracle which will probably enjoy a certain vogue.</p>

<p>For those who, with the late lamented Lieutenant
Totten, see in the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim the
Anglo-Saxons of England and the United States, and
who look upon George V as the king who sits upon the
throne of David, these symbolical stones of the breastplate
acquire an added significance. While not pretending
to be able to follow all the intricate and certainly
most ingenious and interesting speculations of this
school of Biblical exegesis, we cannot help expressing
some astonishment that Ephraim should be thought to
prefigure England and Manasseh the United States, instead
of <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. In Gen. xlviii, 17-20, the text more
especially referred to in these speculations, Jacob’s
blessing is bestowed upon Ephraim, in spite of Joseph’s
protest that it should go to the <i>eldest</i> son, Manasseh. To
this protest Jacob answers: “I know it, my son, I know
it: he also [Manasseh] shall become a people, and he also
shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be
greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of
nations.” Certainly the very composite population of
the United States perfectly merits this description. As
a general rule, the Hebrews, when using the names Ephraim
and Manasseh as tribal designations, maintained
the twelve-fold division of the people, by substituting
these tribes for Joseph and by dropping the name of Levi
from the list, the tribe of Levi being assigned as priests
to the care of the sanctuary, and not participating in the
division of the Land of Promise.</p>

<p>In the Midrash Bemidbar, the Rabbinical commentary
on Numbers, the tribes are given in their order, with the
stone appropriate to each and the color of the tribal
standard pitched in the desert camp, this color corre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>sponding
in each, case with that of the tribal stone. This
list represents a tradition dating back to at least the
twelfth century and possibly much earlier than that;
hence its value should not be underestimated, although
we may not accept it without some reserves.<a id="FNanchor_422_422" href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>In the attempt to determine the identity of the stones
enumerated in Exodus xxviii and xxxix, as adorning the
breastplate of the high-priest, we must bear in mind that
this “breastplate of Aaron” and the one described by
Josephus, and brought by Titus to Rome after the capture
of Jerusalem in 70 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, are in all probability entirely
distinct objects. The former, if it ever existed,
except in the ideal world of the authors of the Priestly
Codex, must have been composed of the stones known to
and used by the Egyptians of the thirteenth or fourteenth
century, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, some of them being, perhaps, set in
the “jewels of gold and jewels of silver” borrowed by

the stones of the breastplate of the Second
Temple, made perhaps in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, should be

<p>I. Odem. [אֹדֶם.] The
etymology of this word
clearly indicates that we
have to do with a red
stone, most probably the
carnelian. We know
that in ancient Egypt
hieroglyphic texts from
the Book of the Dead
were engraved upon
amulets made from this
stone, and it was also
used for early Babylonian
cylinders. Fine
specimens of carnelian
were obtained from
Arabia. The Greek Septuagint
and the Latin Vulgate, as well as Josephus, in the
“Wars of the Jews” (V, 5, 7), and Epiphanius, all translate
<i>sardius</i>, the ancient designation of carnelian; in his
“Antiquities,” however, Josephus renders <i>odem</i> by “sardonyx.”
The Egyptian word <i>chenem</i> was used to designate
red stones, and seems to have been applied indiffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>ently
to red jasper and red feldspar as well as to carnelian;
indeed, the first-named material was more freely
used in early Egyptian work than the carnelian. It is,
therefore, probable that in Mosaic times <i>odem</i> signified
red jasper, while for the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> “carnelian”
would be the better rendering. This modern name of the
<i>sardius</i>, signifying the “flesh-colored” stone, first appears
in the Latin translation of a treatise by Luca ben
Costa, who wrote in the tenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> The name of
Reuben is said to have been engraved on the <i>odem</i> stone,
which occupied the first place on the breastplate.</p>

<p>II. Piṭdah. [פַּטְדָה.] There seems to be little doubt
that this is the <i>topazius</i> of ancient writers, which usually
signified our chrysolite, or peridot, not our topaz; for
Pliny and his successors describe the topazius as a stone
of a greenish hue. A legend related by Pliny gives as
the place of origin an island in the Red Sea, called
Topazos, from <i>topazein</i>, “to conjecture,” because it was
difficult to find. However, the Hebrew <i>piṭdah</i> appears
to have been derived from the Sanskrit <i>piṭa</i>, “yellow,”
and should, therefore, have originally signified a yellow
stone, perhaps our topaz. W. M. Flinders Petrie, probably
influenced by this Sanskrit etymology, sees in it
the yellow serpentine used in ancient Egypt. If, nevertheless,
we admit that a light green stone occupied the
second place on the Mosaic breastplate, it was perhaps
the light green serpentine. This was called <i>meh</i> in
Egyptian, and was often used for amulets. In the case
of the later breastplate we may substitute the peridot.
On this second stone was engraved the name Simeon.</p>

<p>III. Bareketh. [בָּרֶקֶת.] Here the Septuagint, Josephus,
and the Vulgate agree in translating <i>smaragdus</i>,
and as we know that emerald mines were worked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Mount Zabarah, in Nubia, before the beginning of our
era, and that the emerald was known and used in Egypt,
there does not seem to be any reason for rejecting the
usual translation “emerald.” Still it must be admitted
that <i>smaragdus</i> often designates other green stones
than the emerald. The suggestion has been made (by
Myers and Petrie) that the passage in Revelation iv,
3, where the rainbow is likened to the <i>smaragdus</i>, indicates
that the writer used this name for rock-crystal;
but this conjecture is scarcely satisfactory, since it confuses
the prismatic effects of light which has traversed
the crystal with the crystal itself. There can be little
doubt that a stone of brilliant coloration, like the emerald,
not a colorless one, like rock-crystal, would be used as a
simile of the rainbow. Whether the Mosaic breastplate
already contained the emerald is another question, and
it seems rather more likely that green feldspar, freely
used in ancient Egypt for amulets, and known as <i>uat</i>,
was the third stone of the proto-breastplate. The Authorized
Version makes “the carbuncle” the third instead
of the fourth stone. Upon the <i>bereketh</i> was engraved
the name Levi.</p>

<p>IV. Nophek. [נֹפֶךּ.] This name is rendered ἄνθραξ by
the Septuagint and Josephus, and “carbunculus” by
the Vulgate. This designation, signifying literally “a
glowing coal,” was used for certain stones distinguished
by their peculiarly brilliant red color, such as the ruby
and certain fine garnets. While it is quite possible that
the Oriental ruby may have been in the breastplate seen
by Josephus, it is almost certain that it could not have
been in the original breastplate of Mosaic times, since
there is absolutely no proof that this stone was known
in ancient Egypt. Hence we are inclined to believe that
in the thirteenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the name <i>nophek</i> designated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
the almandine garnet, or some similar variety of that
stone. The Authorized Version has “emerald” here instead
of in the third place. On this fourth stone of the
breastplate was engraved the tribal name of Judah.</p>

<p>V. Sappir. [סַפִּיר] This is rendered <i>sapphirus</i> in
all the old versions.<a id="FNanchor_423_423" href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> The stone cannot have been our
sapphire, for both Theophrastus and Pliny describe the
<i>sapphirus</i> as a stone with golden spots, thus showing
that they meant the lapis-lazuli, which is often spotted
with particles of pyrites having a golden sheen. This
stone was named <i>chesbet</i> by the Egyptians, and was
highly prized by them, a quantity of lapis-lazuli often
appearing as an important item in the lists of tribute
paid to Egypt and among the gifts sent by Babylonia
to the Egyptian monarchs, and obtained from the oldest
mines in the world. These were worked at a period 4000
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> and still are worked to this day. From this material
amulets and figures were made, many of which have
been preserved for us, and the Egyptian high-priest is
said to have worn, suspended from his neck, an image of
Mat, the Goddess of Truth, made of lapis-lazuli. The
name is composed of the Latin <i>lapis</i>, “a stone,” and
<i>lajuward</i>, the name of the stone in Persian. From this
latter word is also derived our “azure.” In ancient
times the lapis-lazuli was the blue stone <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>,
because of its beautiful color and the valuable ultramarine
dye derived from it. Although Pliny writes (xxxvii, 39)
that this stone was too soft for engraving, this fact need
not have prevented its use in the breastplate, since the
stones set therein were not intended for use as seals and
hence were not subjected to any wear. In this connec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>tion,
however, it is somewhat strange that the Hebrew
word <i>sappir</i> appears to indicate a stone especially
adapted to receive inscriptions. The fact that the lapis-lazuli
was greatly esteemed in ancient Egypt, and was
still much used as an ornamental stone in Greek and
Roman times, renders it probable that it was set not
only in the original breastplate, but also in that of a later
age. Upon this fifth stone the name Issachar was
inscribed.</p>

<p>VI. Yahalom. [יַהֲלֹם] The sixth stone of the Septuagint
version and of Josephus is the ἴασπις, probably
green jasper, or jade, and this has been assumed
to show that in the original Hebrew text <i>yashpheh</i> was
the sixth stone, in place of <i>yahalom</i>. The twelfth stone
of the Greek version is the ὀνύχιον or “onyx,” and this
seems to be the most probable equivalent of the Hebrew
<i>yahalom</i>. Some Hebrew sources, however, render it
“diamond,” and Luther in his German version of the
Bible, as well as our own Authorized Version, translates
it thus. This rendering is based upon the derivation
of the word <i>yahalom</i> from a verb meaning “to
smite,” thus making the name of the stone signify “the
smiter,” a designation not inappropriate for the diamond,
which, because of its extreme hardness, has the
power to cut, or “smite,” all other stones. However, for
this purpose the emery corundum, or smiris-point <i>shamir</i>,
mentioned in Zechariah, was most likely used. The diamond
was certainly not used in this way in very early
times, although it is possible that the stone was employed
in engraving in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> These considerations
induce us to prefer the traditional interpretation
of <i>yahalom</i>, and translate it “onyx.” In this case “the
smiter” could be explained as denoting the use of the engraved
onyx for sealing, as the engraved figure or letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
were struck upon some soft material to make an impression.
Zebulun was the tribal name inscribed on the
<i>yahalom</i>.</p>

<p>VII. Leshem. [לֶשֶׁם] No stone in the breastplate
is more difficult to determine than this one. The Septuagint,
Josephus, and the Vulgate all translate <i>ligurius</i>,
an appellation sometimes applied to amber, a substance
quite unfitted for use in the breastplate among
the other engraved stones. Probably the original significance
of <i>ligurius</i> was amber, this name being used
because Liguria, in northern Italy, was the chief source
of supply for Greece and the Orient; amber which had
been gathered on the shores of the Baltic being brought
by traders to Liguria and forwarded thence to other
lands. As, however, the Greeks had another name for
amber, <i>electron</i>, the name <i>ligurion</i> appears to have been
applied later to a variety of the jacinth somewhat resembling
amber in color, and then to other varieties of
the same stone. The original form of the name was evidently
<i>ligurion</i>, which was later changed to <i>lyncurion</i>,
and was then explained as meaning the urine of the
lynx (from λύγξ, and οὖρον, urine). This fanciful
etymology gave rise to the story that the <i>ligurios</i>, or
rather <i>lyncurius</i>, was the solidified urine of the lynx.
The term <i>lyncurion</i>, as used by Theophrastus, may possibly
have included the sapphire as well as the jacinth,
since he lays especial stress upon the coldness of this substance,
a quality characteristic of the sapphire, and also
of the still denser jacinth. Hence, it appears that we
have, even in the name <i>ligurius</i>, some justification for
accepting the rendering <i>hyacinthus</i>, suggested by the list
of foundation stones in Revelation xxi, 20, and already
proposed by Epiphanius, Bishop of Constantia, about
400 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Whether <i>hyacinthus</i> should be rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> “sapphire”
or “jacinth” is not easy to determine, as this
name seems to have been used indifferently for both
stones; with the Arabs, under the form <i>yakut</i>, it became
a generic term for all the varieties of the corundum gems.
The sapphire was engraved in Greek and Roman times
and is, perhaps, the <i>leshem</i> stone of the Second Temple.
For the Mosaic breastplate we are forced to seek for
some stone known in ancient Egypt, where the sapphire
does not seem to have been introduced at an early date.
If we could accept the suggestion of Brugsch that the
Egyptian <i>neshem</i> stone, reputed to have wonderful magic
virtues, was the same as the Hebrew <i>leshem</i>, a brown
agate would have been the seventh stone in the original
breastplate, as Wendel gives very strong reasons for
rendering <i>neshem</i> in this way. The color designations
were very freely used in Egyptian, and therefore a
reddish or a yellowish brown agate may have been used.
The <i>leshem</i> bore the tribal name Joseph.</p>

<p>VIII. Shebo. [שְׁבוֹ.] This is uniformly rendered in
the ancient versions and in Josephus by “agate,” a
composite stone highly esteemed in very ancient times,
and hence worthy of a place among the stones of the
breastplate; at a later period, as Pliny notes (xxxvii, 54),
it became so common that it was but little regarded.
Nevertheless the fact that the various kinds of agates
were believed to have many talismanic and therapeutic
virtues, the great variety of coloration observable in
these stones, and the curious figures and markings displayed
by many of them, served to make them favorite
objects. The etymology of the word <i>shebo</i> suggests that
it designated more especially a banded agate, and that
set in the proto-breastplate was most probably one with
gray and white bands, as this variety often appears in
Egyptian work. There would have been no lack of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>trast
between this stone and the reddish or yellowish-brown
agate, of uniform color, which may have occupied
the seventh place. For the later breastplate we may
choose any one of the many kinds of banded agate. This
stone had engraved upon it the name Benjamin.</p>

<p>IX. Aḥlamah. [אַחְלָמָה.] As to this stone also, all the
authorities are in agreement, and render <i>aḥlamah</i> by
“amethyst.” This was not, however, the Oriental amethyst,
a variety of corundum, but a dark blue or purple
variety of quartz. Both Arabia and Syria furnished a
supply of amethysts. The Hebrew name shows that this
stone was believed to possess the virtue of inducing
dreams and visions (cf. <i>halom</i>—“dream”), while, as is
well known, the Greek name characterizes it as an enemy
or preventive of inebriety. The amethyst was known in
ancient Egypt and probably was named <i>hemag</i>. In the
Book of the Dead a heart made of <i>hemag</i> is mentioned,
and two such heart-shaped amulets of amethyst are preserved
in the Boulaq Museum. As the amethyst retained
its repute as a stone of beauty and power through
the Greek and Roman periods, we may safely assert that
it was set in both the first and second breastplates. Upon
the <i>aḥlamah</i> was engraved the name Dan.</p>

<p>X. Tarshish. [תַרשִׁישׁ.] The Septuagint renders this
word “chrysolite,” where it is used in the description of
the breastplate, as does Josephus also. In the Authorized
Version, “beryl” is the rendering. We have already
stated that the topaz of the ancients was usually our
chrysolite, or peridot, and the name “chrysolite” appears
to have been used to designate our topaz. This is indeed
indicated by the literal meaning of the word, “golden-stone.”
The <i>tarshish</i> received its name from Tartessus,
in Spain, an important commercial station of the Phœnicians.
The stone derived from this source was not, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
course, our Oriental topaz, a variety of corundum, nor
was it the true topaz; neither is it at all likely that the
name <i>tarshish</i> signified, at least originally, the genuine
topaz; most probably it denoted a variety of quartz which
occurs in Spain. This is originally black, but is decolorized
by heating to a deep brown, and if the heating be
prolonged the stone becomes paler and eventually entirely
transparent. The ancients were familiar with this
property. In ancient Egyptian records a stone called
<i>thehen</i> is frequently mentioned as a material from which
amulets were made. This Egyptian name signified primarily
a “yellow stone,” and might designate either the
topaz or the yellow jasper, known and used in Egypt at
a very early date; the topaz was probably not known
there earlier than 500 or 600 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Hence, in spite of the
unquestionable difficulty offered by the geographical
name <i>tarshish</i>, which might seem to confine us to a
Spanish origin for the stone, the probabilities favor the
selection of the yellow jasper as the tenth gem in Aaron’s
breastplate. For that made with pious zeal by those who
labored to renew the glories of the Old Jerusalem, we
choose the topaz,—possibly, indeed, a fine specimen of
the genuine topaz,—for whatever the quality of the yellow
stone originally brought from Tartessus, the name may
well have been applied to the genuine topaz when that
stone became known to the Jews, either in Babylonia, or
after their return to Palestine. The <i>tarshish</i> was engraved
with the name Naphtali.</p>

<p>XI. Shoham. [שֹׁהַם.] The Septuagint translates
“beryl,” but in our Authorized Version and in that used
by Roman Catholics, the so-called Douai Version, the
word is invariably rendered “onyx.” Diodorus Siculus
and Dionysius Periegetes, writing in the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>,
are the first classical authors who use the name beryl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
While this name does not appear in the treatise of Theophrastus,
he evidently includes the beryl among his
<i>smaragdi</i>; indeed, the true emerald is simply a variety
of the beryl, and owes its beautiful coloration to a slight
admixture of chromium. The finest beryls were brought
from India. Besides the specimen set in the breastplate,
the high-priest wore on his shoulders two <i>shoham</i> stones,
each engraved with the names of six of the tribes. After
carefully weighing the evidence, we believe that the
stones worn by the high-priest of the Second Temple were
aquamarines (beryls). In our endeavor to determine the
<i>shoham</i> stones used in Mosaic times, we have no very
definite information to guide us; on the whole, the conjecture
of J. L. Myers, that they were malachites, seems
to have much in its favor, for this material was known
to the ancient Egyptians and appears to have been often
used for amulets. The Egyptian name for malachite,
as well as for other green stones, was <i>mafek</i>, and a ring
of <i>mafek</i> is mentioned in an Egyptian text; undoubtedly,
at a later period in Egyptian history, <i>mafek</i> may also
have denoted the beryl. In view of the fact that the turquoise
was unquestionably known to the Egyptians at a
very early date, the supply being derived from mines in
the Sinai Peninsula, which were rediscovered by Macdonald,
we might be tempted to suggest that the <i>shoham</i>
stones were turquoises. The light blue or blue-green of
the specimens of this stone found on Mt. Sinai would
make an even better contrast with the neighboring jade
than would the bright green malachite. On the shoham
of the breastplate the name Gad was engraved.</p>

<p>XII. Yashpheh. [יָשְׁפֶה.] If, as appears almost certain,
this name originally occupied the sixth place in
the original Hebrew text, all the ancient versions agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
in translating it “jasper.” An Assyrian form of the
name was <i>yashpu</i>, as is shown by the Tell el Amarna
letters in the cuneiform writing dating from not long
before the Exodus. Of all the so-called jaspers none were
so highly valued as those of a green color. The talismanic
and therapeutic qualities of the “green jaspers”
are often noted by ancient writers, and, according to
Galen, these stones were recommended for remedial use
by Egyptian writers on medicine. Abel Remusat, the
great French Orientalist, writing in 1820, was one of the
first to see in the <i>yashpheh</i> of the Hebrews and in the
green jasper of the Greeks and Romans, the material
jade (nephrite or jadeite), the Chinese <i>yu</i>-stone. These
minerals were used both in the Old and the New World,
and were everywhere believed to possess wonderful
virtues. Very likely the powers supposed to characterize
jade were later attributed to green jasper, but
there is every reason to suppose that the true jade was
always more highly prized than its jasper substitute, for
it was much rarer, and was easily distinguishable, by its
translucency, from jasper of a similar color. Until quite
recently only Turkestan, Burma and New Zealand have
supplied jade and most of that used in other lands came
from prehistoric relics or from sources unknown to us. It
seems highly probable that the <i>yashpheh</i> which adorned
the breastplate made for Aaron was a piece of nephrite or
jadeite; possibly in the later breastplate green jasper
may have been employed. This stone was inscribed with
the tribal name Assher.</p>

<p>In the following lists of the precious and semi-precious
stones contained in the earlier and later breastplates,
the writer does not claim to have finally solved
the problem presented by the Hebrew accounts of the
high-priest’s adornment, but he hopes that the distinc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>tion
established here between the Mosaic breastplate and
that of the Second Temple, separated from each other by
an interval of eight centuries, may serve to clear up some
of the difficulties encountered in the treatment of this
subject.</p>

<p>The high-priest’s breastplate, as described in Hebrew
tradition, was regarded by the Jews with peculiar reverence,
and the stones set in it were believed to be emblematic
of many things. It is, therefore, quite natural
that these stones are described in the book of Revelation
as the foundation stones of the New Jerusalem. The
names are in some cases not identical with those given in
Exodus, but this may arise from various renderings of
the Hebrew names in the Targums or in the Greek
versions.</p>

<p>The text in Revelation (xxi, 9-21) is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying,
Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife:</p>

<p>And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain,
and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending
out of heaven from God.</p>

<p>Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
most precious, even like a jasper-stone, clear as crystal;</p>

<p>And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the
names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</p>

<p>On the east, three gates; on the north, three gates; on the south,
three gates; and on the west, three gates.</p>

<p>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>

<p>And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city,
and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</p>

<p>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.
The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</p>

<p>And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</p>

<p>And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the
second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</p>

<p>The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite;
the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the
eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>

<p>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was
of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is easy to trace in this description the substitution
of the twelve apostles for the twelve tribes in connection
with the precious stones enumerated, and, besides this,
we also have the twelve angels, associated at a later date
with the months and the signs of the zodiac.</p>

<p>Of the twelve foundation stones the Revelation of
St. John expressly states that they had “in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” The assignment
of each stone to the respective apostle was made
in later times according to the order given in the lists of
the apostles contained in the so-called Synoptic Gospels,
Matthew, Mark, and Luke. These lists are not quite
identical—Andrew, for instance, being placed second in
Matthew and Luke, but fourth in Mark—and the same
stone was not always assigned to a given apostle. Frequently
the list was modified by the addition of the
apostle Paul, really the thirteenth apostle. In this case
he was usually given the second place immediately after
St. Peter, and to the brothers James and John, the “Sons
of Thunder,” was assigned a single stone; in some later
arrangements St. Paul occupies the last place, after St.
Matthias, who was chosen to take the place of Judas
Iscariot, and whose name as an apostle first appears in
the Acts.</p>

<p>The passage in Revelation xxi, 19, 20, is not the only
one in that book treating of precious stones, for we read
in chapter iv, 2, 3:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And immediately I was in the Spirit: and, behold, a throne was
set in heaven, and <i>one</i> sat on the throne.</p>

<p>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
stone: and <i>there was</i> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like
unto an emerald.</p></blockquote>

<p>The commentators, both ancient and modern, have
given many different explanations of the symbolic meaning
of the similes employed here. Some have seen in the
two stones a type of the two judgments of the world, by
fire and by water; others find that they signify the holiness
of God and his justice. Of the rainbow “like unto
an emerald,” Alford says we should not think it strange
that the bow is green, instead of prismatic: “the <i>form</i>
is that of the covenant bow, the color even more refreshing
and more directly symbolizing grace and mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_424_424" href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>The significance of the twelve Apocalyptic gems is
given by Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz (786-856),
in the following words:<a id="FNanchor_425_425" href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the jasper is figured the truth of faith; in the sapphire, the
height of celestial hope; in the chalcedony, the flame of inner charity.
In the emerald is expressed the strength of faith in adversity; in the
sardonyx, the humility of the saints in spite of their virtues; in the
sard, the venerable blood of the martyrs. In the chrysolite, indeed, is
shown true spiritual preaching accompanied by miracles; in the beryl,
the perfect operation of prophecy; in the topaz, the ardent contemplation
of the prophecies. Lastly, in the chrysoprase is demonstrated
the work of the blessed martyrs and their reward; in the hyacinth, the
celestial rapture of the learned in their high thoughts and their humble
descent to human things out of regard for the weak; in the amethyst,
the constant thought of the heavenly kingdom in humble souls.</p></blockquote>

<p>The origin of the foundation stones named in Revelation
xxi, 19, 20, may be found in the text, Isaiah liv,
11, 12, where we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold,
I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with
sapphires.</p>

<p>And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles,
and all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p></blockquote>

<p>As we see, only three stones are mentioned by name:
the sapphire, the carbuncle, and “agates.” This last
rendering is quite doubtful, as the Hebrew word (<i>kodkodim</i>)
signifies shining or gleaming stones, and their
use for windows indicates that they must have been
transparent. It is easy to understand that in later times
the twelve stones of the breastplate, dedicated to the
twelve tribes of Israel, were used to fill out and com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>plete
the picture, following the indication given by the
general terms “stones with fair colours” and “pleasant
stones.”</p>

<p>In commenting on this text Rabbi Johanan is quoted
in the Babylonian Talmud as saying that God would
bring jewels and pearls thirty ells square (twenty ells
in height and ten in width) and would place them on the
gates of Jerusalem. There may be in this some reminiscence
of the Apocalyptic foundation stones. A sceptical
disciple said to the Rabbi, “We do not ever find a
jewel as large as the egg of a dove.” But not long afterward,
when this same disciple was sailing in a boat on
the sea, he saw angels sawing stones as immense as those
described by Rabbi Johanan, and when he asked for what
they were designed, the reply was, “The Holy One,
blessed be He, will place them on the gates of Jerusalem.”<a id="FNanchor_426_426" href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a><br />

<small>Birth-Stones</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE origin of the belief that to each month of the year
a special stone was dedicated, and that the stone
of the month was endowed with a peculiar virtue for
those born in that month and was their natal stone, may
be traced back to the writings of Josephus, in the first
century of our era, and to those of St. Jerome, in the
early part of the fifth century. Both these authors distinctly
proclaim the connection between the twelve stones
of the high-priest’s breastplate and the twelve months of
the year, as well as the twelve zodiacal signs. Strange to
say, however, in spite of this early testimony, we have no
instance of the usage of wearing such stones as natal
stones until a comparatively late date; indeed, it appears
that this custom originated in Poland some time during
the eighteenth century. The reason for this seems to
have been that the virtues attributed to each particular
stone, more especially the therapeutic virtues, rendered
it necessary to recommend the wearing of one or the
other, according to the disease from which the person was
suffering, for his natal stone might not have the power
to cure his particular ailment, or might not bring about
the fulfilment of his dearest wish. In other words, the
belief in the special virtues of the stone was paramount,
and it was long before the mystic bond between the stone
of the month and the person born in that month was
fully realized.</p>

<p>The order in which the foundation stones of the New
Jerusalem are given in the book of Revelation deter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>mined
the succession of natal stones for the months. The
first stone was assigned to St. Peter and to the month
of March, to the leader of the apostles and to the month
of the spring equinox; the second to the month of April;
the third to May, etc. When, however, many centuries
later,—probably in Poland, as we have stated,—with the
aid of the rabbis or the Hebrew gem traders, the wearing
of natal stones became usual, certain changes had been
made in this order and some stones not mentioned among
those of the breastplate, or of the New Jerusalem, were
substituted for certain of these,—notably the turquoise
for the month of December, the ruby for July, and the
diamond for April. In modern times the turquoise has
become the stone for July while the ruby has been assigned
to December.</p>

<p>There is some evidence in favor of the theory that at
the outset all twelve stones were acquired by the same
person and worn in turn, each one during the respective
month to which it was assigned, or during the ascendancy
of its zodiacal sign. The stone of the month was believed
to exercise its therapeutic or talismanic virtue to
the fullest extent at that period. Perhaps the fact that
this entailed a monthly change of ornaments may rather
have been a recommendation of the usage than the
reverse.<a id="FNanchor_427_427" href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<p>It seems highly probable that the development of the
belief in natal stones that took place in Poland was due
to the influence of the Jews who settled in that country
shortly before we have historic notice of the use of the
twelve stones for those born in the respective months.
The lively interest always felt by the Jews regarding the
gems of the breastplate, the many and various commen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>taries
their learned men have written upon this subject,
and the fact that the well-to-do among the chosen people
have always carried with them in their wanderings many
precious stones, all this seems to make it likely that to
the Jews should be attributed the fashion of wearing
natal stones.</p>

<p>However, whether this conjecture be correct or erroneous,
the fashion once started became soon quite general
and has as many votaries to-day as ever before.
There can be no doubt that the owner of a ring or ornament
set with a natal stone is impressed with the idea of
possessing something more intimately associated with
his or her personality than any other stone, however
beautiful or costly it may be. If it be objected that this
is nothing but imagination due to sentiment, we must
bear in mind that imagination is one of the most potent
factors in our life; indeed, the great Napoleon is quoted
as saying that it ruled the world.</p>

<p>Probably the very earliest text we have in which the
stones of the breastplate are positively associated with
the months of the year is to be found in the “Antiquities
of the Jews,” by Flavius Josephus.<a id="FNanchor_428_428" href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> This runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the vestments of the high-priest being made of linen
signifies the earth, the blue denotes the sky, being like lightning in its
pomegranates, and resembling thunder in the noise of the bells. And as
for the ephod, it showed that God had made the universe of four elements,
and as for the gold interwoven in it, I suppose it related to the
splendor by which all things are to be enlightened. He also appointed
the breastplate to be placed in the middle of the ephod to resemble the
earth, for that occupies the middle place in the world; and the girdle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
which encompassed the high priest about, signifies the ocean, for that
goes about everything. And the two sardonyxes that were in the clasps
on the high-priest’s shoulders, indicate to us the sun and the moon.
And for the twelve stones, whether we understand by them the months,
or the twelve signs of what the Greeks call the zodiac, we shall not be
mistaken in their meaning. And for the cap, which was of a blue
color, it seems to me to mean heaven, for otherwise the name of God
would not have been inscribed upon it. That it was also adorned
with a crown, and that of gold also, is because of the splendor with
which God is pleased.</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage was adapted by St. Jerome, three hundred
years later, in his letter to Fabiola,<a id="FNanchor_429_429" href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> and undoubtedly
laid the foundation for the later custom of wearing
one of these stones as a natal or birth-stone for a person
born in a given month, or for an astral or zodiacal stone
for one born under a given zodiacal sign. As we see,
both uses are indicated by the passage of Josephus. In
the later centuries, as the book of Revelation, which was
generally less favored at the outset than the other parts
of the New Testament, became a subject of devout study,
and a mine of mystical suggestions, the twelve foundation
stones (Rev. xxi, 19) of the New Jerusalem largely
took the place of the stones of the breastplate. While
this list of foundation stones is unquestionably based
upon the much earlier list of the stones adorning Aaron’s
breastplate, the ordering differs considerably and there
are some changes in the material; possibly many, if not
all, of these differences may be due to textual errors or
to a transcription from memory.</p>

<p>That the foundation stones were inscribed with the
names of the apostles is expressly stated (Rev. xxi, 14),
but it was not until the eighth or ninth century that the
commentators on Revelation busied themselves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
finding analogies between these stones and the apostles.
At the outset, the symbolism of the stones was looked
upon from a purely religious standpoint. Few of the
early fathers—we may except Epiphanius—thought or
cared much for the stones themselves, or knew much of
them; but, in time, their natural beauty became more and
more highly developed as the lapidarian art demanded
better cut and choicer material, their supposed virtues
came to the fore, and the symbolism was strengthened and
emphasized by a reference to their innate qualities and
also to their peculiar powers. The fact that this part of
the tradition was rather of pagan than of Christian
origin probably contributed to render it less attractive
to the early Christians, so that it was not until Christianity
had become practically universal in the Greek and
Roman world and the opposition to pagan traditions, as
such, was weakened and, indeed, largely forgotten, that
the virtues of the stones were made prominent, and certain
parts of these superstitions were retained, as were
some of the pagan ceremonies in the Christian religion.</p>

<p>One of the earliest writers to associate directly with
the apostles the symbolism of the gems given as foundation
stones of the New Jerusalem by St. John in Revelation
xxi, 19, is Andreas, bishop of Cæsarea. This author
was at one time assigned by critics to the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_430_430" href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> but more recent investigation has shown that he
probably belonged to the last half of the tenth century.
His exposition reads as follows:<a id="FNanchor_431_431" href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The jasper, which like the emerald is of a greenish hue, probably
signifies St. Peter, chief of the apostles, as one who so bore Christ’s
death in his inmost nature that his love for Him was always vigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
and fresh. By his fervent faith he has become our shepherd and
leader.</p>

<p>As the sapphire is likened to the heavens (from this stone is made
a color popularly called lazur), I conceive it to mean St. Paul, since
he was caught up to the third heaven, where his soul was firmly
fixed. Thither he seeks to draw all those who may be obedient to him.</p>

<p>The chalcedony was not inserted in the high-priest’s breastplate,
but instead the carbuncle, of which no mention is made here. It may
well be, however, that the author designated the carbuncle by the name
chalcedony. Andrew, then, can be likened to the carbuncle, since he
was splendidly illumined by the fire of the Spirit.</p>

<p>The emerald, which is of a green color, is nourished with oil, that
its transparency and beauty may not change; we conceive this stone
to signify John the Evangelist. He, indeed, soothed the souls dejected
by sin with a divine oil, and by the grace of his excellent
doctrine lends constant strength to our faith.</p>

<p>By the sardonyx, showing with a certain transparency and purity
the color of the human nail, we believe that James is denoted, seeing
that he bore death for Christ before all others. This the nail by its
color indicates, for it may be cut off without any sensible pain.</p>

<p>The sardius with its tawny and translucent coloring suggests
fire, and it possesses the virtue of healing tumors and wounds inflicted
by iron; hence I consider that it designates the beauty of virtue characterizing
the apostle Philip, for his virtue, animated by the fire of
the Holy Spirit, cured the soul of the wounds inflicted by the wiles
of the devil, and revived it.</p>

<p>The chrysolite, gleaming with the splendor of gold, may symbolize
Bartholomew, since he was illustrious for his divine preaching and
his store of virtues.</p>

<p>The beryl, imitating the colors of the sea and of the air, and not
unlike the jacinth, seems to suggest the admirable Thomas, especially
as he made a long journey by sea, and even reached the Indies, sent
by God to preach salvation to the peoples of that region.</p>

<p>The topaz, which is of a ruddy color, resembling somewhat the
carbuncle, stops the discharge of the milky fluid with which those
having eye-disease suffer. This seems to denote Matthew, for he was
animated by a divine zeal, and, his blood being fired because of
Christ, he was found worthy to enlighten by his Gospel those whose
heart was blinded, that they might like new-born children drink of
the milk of the faith.</p>

<p>The chrysoprase, more brightly tinged with a golden hue than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
gold itself, symbolizes St. Thaddæus; the gold (<i>chrysos</i>) symbolizing
the kingdom of Christ, and the <i>prassius</i>, Christ’s death, both of which
he preached to Abgar, King of Edessa.</p>

<p>The jacinth, which is of a celestial hue, signifies Simon Zelotes,
zealous for the gifts and grace of Christ and endowed with a celestial
prudence.</p>

<p>By the amethyst, which shows to the onlooker a fiery aspect, is
signified Matthias, who in the gift of tongues was so filled with celestial
fire and with fervent zeal to serve and please God, who had chosen him,
that he was found worthy to take the place of the apostate Judas.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some theologians were opposed to the assignment of
the foundation stones to the apostles, for they held that
only Christ himself could be regarded as the foundation
of his Church. Hence the symbolism of these stones was
made to apply to Christ alone, the color of the stone often
guiding the commentator in his choice of ideas denoted
by the different gems. Thus, one writer, applying all the
meanings to Christ, finds that the greenish Jasper denotes
satisfaction; the sky-blue Sapphire, the soul; the
bright-red Chalcedony, zeal for truth; the transparent
green Emerald, kindness and goodness; the nail-colored
Sardonyx, the strength of spiritual life; the red Sardius,
readiness to shed His blood for the Church; the yellow
Chrysolite, the excellence of His divine nature; the sea-green
Beryl, moderation and the control of the passions;
the glass-green Topaz (chrysolite?), uprightness; the
harsh-colored Chrysoprase, sternness towards sinners;
the violet or purple Jacinth, royal dignity, and, lastly, the
purple Amethyst, with a touch of red, perfection.<a id="FNanchor_432_432" href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>Andreas of Cæsarea freely recognizes his indebtedness
to the much more ancient source, St. Epiphanius,
bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, who died in 402 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,
and who wrote a short but very valuable treatise on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
stones of the breastplate, noting in several cases the therapeutic
and talismanic virtues of these stones and giving
his opinion as to the order in which the names of the
tribes were inscribed upon them.<a id="FNanchor_433_433" href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> As the foundation
stones of Revelation are rightly called “apostolic
stones,” so those of the breastplate merit the designation
of “tribal stones,” as well as that of astral stones;
indeed, the Jews of medieval times definitely associated
the tribes with the zodiacal signs in the following order:</p>

<p>For Rabanus Maurus the nine gems of the king of
Tyre named in Ezekiel xxxviii, 13, are types of the nine
orders of angels, just as the twelve foundation stones of
Revelation signify the twelve apostles.<a id="FNanchor_434_434" href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<p>It is evident, from early and later usage, that, at the
place and time where and when these stones were first
utilized for birth-stones, the year must have begun with
the month of March. This will be apparent when we

<p>With the exception of January, where we have the
garnet instead of the jacinth, and of December, which
gives us the ruby instead of the chrysoprase, the first
choices are practically identical with the foundation
stones, bearing in mind that the eleventh stone is that for
January, the twelfth that for February, the first that for
March and so on.</p>

<p>Of the assignment of the natal stones to the different
months of the year or to the zodiacal signs, Poujet fils,
writing in 1762, states that in his opinion this fashion
started in Germany—others say in Poland—some two
centuries before his time, and he adds that, though this
arrangement was purely imaginary, and unknown to ancient
writers, it soon became popular, and many, more
especially of the fair sex, seeing in it an element of mystery,
wished to wear rings set with the stone appropriate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
to the month of their birth, the stone being engraved with
the appropriate zodiacal sign.<a id="FNanchor_435_435" href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> However correct Poujet
may be regarding the period at which the fashion of
wearing natal rings was introduced, he is, as we have
already shown, quite wrong in believing that the serial
arrangement of the stones and their assignment to
months or signs was purely imaginary, for it is unquestionably
based on the list in Revelation, which in its turn
goes back to the twelve stones of the high-priest’s breastplate.</p>

<p><small>The original ring, which is of chalcedony, is shown on St. Agatha’s
Day, July 29, to cure ailments of mothers. This cord and facsimile of ring

<p>The fashion of wearing a series of twelve stones denoting
(or bearing) the zodiacal signs seems to have existed
in the sixteenth century, for Catherine de’ Medici
is said to have worn a girdle set with twelve stones,
among which were certain onyxes as large as crownpieces,
upon which talismanic designs had been engraved.
Two hundred years later this girdle is stated to have been
in the possession of a M. d’Ennery, whose collection of
antique medals was regarded as the finest in Paris at the
time.<a id="FNanchor_436_436" href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> It is not, however, certain that the twelve stones
of Catherine’s girdle were those attributed to the zodiacal
signs both at an earlier and later period.</p>

<p>Though the substitution of a new schedule for the time-honored
list of birth-stones has received the approval
of the National Association of Jewellers at the meeting
in Kansas City August, 1912, it can scarcely be said to
offer a satisfactory solution of the question, which has
its importance not only from a commercial point of view,
but also because the idea that birth-stones possess a certain
indefinable, but none the less real significance, has
long been present and still exercises a spell over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
minds of all who are gifted with a touch of imagination,
or romance, if you will. The longing for something that
appeals to this sense is much more general than is commonly
supposed, and is a not unnatural reaction against
the progress of materialism, against the assertion that
there is nothing in heaven or earth but what we can definitely
apprehend through our senses.</p>

<p>It is this persuasion that should be chiefly considered
in any attempt to tamper with the traditional attribution
of the stones to particular months or to the zodiacal signs.
Once we allow the spirit of commercialism pure and
simple to dictate the choice of such stones, according to
the momentary interest of dealers, there is grave danger
that the only true incentive to acquire birth-stones will
be weakened and people will lose interest in them. Sentiment,
true sentiment, is one of the best things in human
nature. While if darkened by fear it may lead to pessimism,
with all the evils which such a state of mind implies,
if illumined by hope it gives to humanity a brighter
forecast of the future, an optimism that helps people
over difficult passages in their lives. Thus, sentiment
must not be neglected, and nothing is more likely to destroy
it than the conviction that it is being constantly
exploited for purposes of commercialism. For this
reason, the interest as well as the inclination of all who
are concerned in this question of birth-stones should induce
a very careful handling of the subject.</p>

<p>Quite true it is that there are now, and have been in
the past, several lists of these stones, differing slightly
from one another, but all are based essentially either
upon the list of foundation stones given in Revelation
(xxi, 19) or upon that of the gems adorning the breastplate
of Aaron and enumerated in Exodus (xxxix, 10-13).
For convenient reference, we give the latter according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
the Authorized Version of the Scriptures, and also as corrected
by later research, and the former according to the
Authorized Version.</p>

<p>While the arrangement differs in Revelation, the
stones are nearly identical. For chalcedonius, we should
probably read <i>carchedonius</i>, a name of the ruby; sardonyx
is the onyx of Exodus; the jacinth (sapphire) is
probably the “ligure”; the sapphire was the lapis-lazuli,
and sardius is equivalent to carnelian. There thus remains
only the chrysoprase, which for some reason
has substituted the agate. In the eventual association of
the foundation stones with the months, the first, the
jasper, was assigned to March, with which month the year
was reckoned to begin.</p>

<p>The list suggested and adopted in Kansas City reads
as follows:</p>

<p>Among the many changes in this list from that habitually
followed, it will be noted that the ruby is transferred
from December to July, changing places with the
turquoise, which became the gem of December. This has
been favored on the ground that the warmer-colored gem
was best adapted for a July birth-stone, while the paler
turquoise was best suited to a winter month, when the
sun’s rays are feeble. The contrary, however, is true;
for it is in winter that we seek for warmth, while in the
heat of summer nothing is more grateful than coolness.
This transposition is, in effect, simply a return to the
ordering of these stones in the Polish list, which may perhaps
have become popular in Europe in the eighteenth
century through Marie Leczinska, the queen of Louis XV.
Another undesirable change takes the chrysolite (peridot)
from the place it has always occupied as the gem
of September, and makes of it an alternate for August,
with the sardonyx, while the sapphire, properly the gem
for April, is made the birth-stone for September. For
October neither the tourmaline nor the opal is as appropriate
as the beryl, while for June we should prefer the
asteria to the moonstone as a substitute for the pearl.</p>

<p>This suggested radical change or violation cannot be
permitted. The time-honored ordering is familiar now
to all who are interested in the matter, and any change,
even if one apparently for the better, is liable to disturb
the popular confidence in those who are supposed to be
familiar with the subject. Above all, there should be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
duplication or triplication of birth-stones for any given
month, the choice between a birth-stone or an astral or
zodiacal stone or the combination of these affording all
the variety that is necessary or should be desired.</p>

<p>As the diamond does not appear to have been known
to the ancients and is not given in any of the lists of
birth-stones before the last century, and as diamonds,
like gold and platinum, may easily be used as accessories
to other stones, would it not perhaps be better to omit
the diamond from the list of the stones of the months,
and rather use these gems as a bordering or other ornate
addition to the stone of the month? The pearl, which is
not a stone in any sense of the word, should not appear
in the list at all; but it can be worn in some device suggesting
a sentiment, as, for instance, an emblem of
purity, etc.</p>

<p>The tourmaline, as a gem only known in modern times
or since the eighteenth century, seems out of place in the
list of birth-stones, which ought only to comprise precious
or semi-precious stones which have been known and worn
from ancient times.</p>

<p>“Astral stones” or “zodiacal stones” are terms used
to designate those gems which were believed to be peculiarly
and mystically related to the zodiacal signs.
While these signs constitute a twelve-fold division of the
year just as do the months, they do not exactly coincide
with the latter as now reckoned, but overlap them, so that
the sign Aquarius, for instance, covers the period from
January 21 to February 20, that of Pisces from February
21 to March 20, that of Aries, the spring sign, from
March 21 to April 20, and so on down to Capricornus,
which begins at the winter solstice. Thus, every necessary
opportunity is afforded for enlarging the selection
of natal stones while preserving the traditional order of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
those appropriate to the months, an order which in its
origin dates back to the early Christian centuries and
which, from the close relation with the sacred gems of the
Scriptures, it seems almost sacrilegious to violate by
arbitrary changes.</p>

<p>Then, in addition, we have the “talismanic gems,”
or the stones of the twelve guardian angels, one set over
all those born in each month. Here we have another
time-honored list, differing from either of those mentioned
above, so that, in almost if not quite every
case, each person has the choice between three different
stones as “birth-stones,” or can have them combined in
an artistic jewel so as to profit by all the favorable influ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>ences
promised by the old authorities Thus, there is
absolutely no excuse for playing fast and loose with an
ancient, popular, and quasi-religious belief in the special
virtue of <i>one particular stone</i> for each month, and that
one the gem long prescribed by usage</p>

<p>As it might seem appropriate that one born in the
United States should wear a gem from among those
which our country furnishes, the following list was some
time since prepared by the writer, not in any sense as a
substitute for the real birth-stones, but as possible accessory
gems (when they were not identical), gems which
might be worn from a spirit of patriotism Of course
where the stone in question is really that traditionally
recommended, the fact that it is at the same time an
American gem-stone is an added argument in its favor</p>

<p>The year is divided into four seasons or cycles,—spring,
summer, fall, and winter,—and each season has
its particular gem The emerald is the gem of the spring,
the ruby the gem of summer, the sapphire the gem of
autumn, and the diamond the gem of winter</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>For spring, no precious stone is more appropriate
than the emerald. Its beautiful color is that of Nature,
for Nature clothes herself with green when she awakens
from her long rest of winter. Having decked herself
with green of the various tints and colors, she has selected
a background by which a contrast is made for the
flowers that come in the spring and summer and ripen
into fruit and seeds of autumn. To be a seasonable gem
it must be rare, and the emerald is rare. Whether found
in the mines of Bogotá, whether mined in ancient times
at Zabarah in Egypt, or in the past century in the Ural
Mountains, it has never been found in abundance. It is
softer in color than the ruby and less hard in structure.</p>

<p>The ruby, although as a natal stone it belongs to December,
is the gem of summer. It is born in the hot
climates,—the pigeon’s-blood ruby in Burma, the pomegranate-red
in Ceylon, and the more garnet-hued type in
Siam,—these three equatorial countries produce the
ruby. Those of large size are always rare, and this is
the gem which Job valued more highly than any other,
although “garnet” may perhaps be a better rendering.
It is on an equal plane in hardness, in composition, in
crystalline structure, and in every way, with the sapphire.
These are sister gems, structurally alike, yet
varying in complexion, due to a slight difference which
some scientists think is not even dependent upon the
coloring matter.</p>

<p>The sapphire—the gem of autumn, the blue of the
autumn sky—is a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy.
Less vivid than its sister gem, the ruby, it typifies
calm and tried affection, not ardent passion; it is
therefore appropriate to the autumn season, when the
declining sun no longer sends forth the fiery rays of
summer but shines with a tempered brilliancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>The diamond, the gem of winter, typifying the sun, is
the gem of light. Its color is that of ice, and as the dewdrop
or the drop of water from a mountain stream
sparkles in the light of the sun, as the icicle sparkles in
winter, and the stars on a cold winter night, so the diamond
sparkles, and it combines and contrasts with all
known gems. Like light, it illumines them just as the
sun does the plants of the earth. The diamond, the gem
of light, like light itself when broken into a spectrum,
gives us all known colors, and by combining all these
colors it gives us white. Like gold, the diamond was
made rare, so that it must be searched for, and the mines
and deposits contain less of these two substances in a
given area than of any other known materials. It is
thirty to a hundred times more rare than gold, for if
gold occurs one part in 250,000, it can scarcely be worked
with profit, while the diamond can be worked to advantage
when found only one part in 10,000,000,—yes, even
one part in 25,000,000—and, like gold, it sometimes
spurs the searcher on to wealth or to ruin. As great
nuggets of gold have occasionally been found, so has a
diamond been discovered large enough to make the
greatest ruler pause to pay its price, and one which it
took an entire country to give to that ruler who sways
his sceptre over countries in which the world’s greatest
diamonds have been found.</p>

<p>When the God of the Mines called his courtiers to
bring him all known gems, he found them to be of all
colors and tints, and of varying hardnesses, such as the
ruby, emerald, sapphire, etc., etc. He took one of each;
he crushed them; he compounded them, and said: “Let
this be something that will combine the beauty of all;
yet it must be pure, and it must be invincible.” He
spoke: and lo! the diamond was born, pure as the dew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>drop
and invincible in hardness; but when its ray is resolved
in the spectrum, it displays all the colors of the
gems from which it was made “Mine,” said the god,
“must be the gem of the universe; for my queen I will
create one that shall be the greatest gem of the sea,”
and for her he created the pearl</p>

<p>When the zodiacal signs were engraved on gems to
give them special virtues and render them of greater
efficacy for those born under a given sign, the Hebrew
characters designating the sign (or at least the initial
character) were often cut upon the gem. As the letters
in which the earliest of our sacred writings were written,
a peculiar sanctity was often ascribed to these Hebrew
characters, which were perhaps the more highly valued
that they were unknown to the owners of the gems, and
hence possessed a certain air of mystery for them. The
subjoined list of the signs with the Hebrew equivalents
may be of interest on this account.</p>

<p>Saturday’s talismanic gem: the amethyst.</p>
</div>

<p>No gems have afforded more interest to the Oriental
peoples than those that are known as phenomenal gems;
that is, such as exhibit a phenomenal quality, either as
a moving line as in the chrysoberyl cat’s-eye, or the
quartz cat’s-eye, or as a star, a class represented by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
star-sapphire and the star-ruby, all these being considered
to bring good fortune to the wearer. A splendid
star-sapphire is in the hilt of the sword presented as an
Easter gift to King Constantine of Greece, then Prince
Constantine, by the Greeks of America, on Easter Day
1913.<a id="FNanchor_438_438" href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> This ornate and beautiful sword was made by
Tiffany &amp; Co. Then there is the alexandrite cat’s-eye
which, in addition to its chatoyant effect, changes from
green to red, showing its natural color by day and glowing
with a ruddy hue by artificial light. The cat’s-eye effect
here is caused by a twinning of the crystal; that is, when
the gem is cut, with a dome, across the twinning line, this
shows itself as a smooth band of white light, with a translucent
or transparent space at one side, the line varying
in sharpness and in breadth as the illumination becomes
more intense. If the light is very bright, the line is no
wider than the thinnest possible silver or platinum wire.</p>

<p>The quartz cat’s-eye, less distinct than the chrysoberyl
cat’s-eye, is also found in the East, and possesses
the property that when cut straight across, an apparent
striation in the stone produces the cat’s-eye effect, but
the material is not so rich or brilliant nor is the gem as
beautiful as is the true cat’s-eye. The alexandrite variety
of chrysoberyl is colored by chromium and is dichroitic,
appearing green when viewed in one direction and red
in another; in artificial light, however, the green color is
lost and the red alone becomes apparent.</p>

<p>The moonstone, with its moonlike, silvery-white light,
changes on the surface as the light varies. This is due
to a chatoyancy produced by a reflection caused by certain
cleavage planes present in feldspar of the variety to
which the moonstone belongs.</p>

<p>Fashion in some parts of the Orient dictates the use
of special colors for raiment and jewels to be worn on
the different days of the week. In Siam deep red silks
and rubies are appropriate for Sunday wear; white fabrics
and moonstones are prescribed for Monday; light
red garments and coral ornaments are favored for Tuesday;
striped stuffs and jewels set with the cat’s-eye are
considered the proper wear for Wednesday; green materials
and emeralds are decreed for Thursday; silver-blue
robes and ornaments set with diamonds are chosen for
Friday, and on Saturday those who obey the dictates
of fashion are clad in dark blue garments and wear sapphires
of a similar hue.</p>

<p>Our age is not satisfied with the marvellous progress
of science, which has rendered possible the realization
of many of the old magicians’ dreams. In spite of this
there seems to be a growing tendency to revive many of
the old beliefs which appeared to have been definitely
discarded; therefore we need not be surprised that the
nineteenth century offers us a work on the magic art,
written precisely in the spirit that animated an Agrippa
or a Porta in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_439_439" href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a>
This work gives elaborate directions as to the manner in
which the “Magus” should proceed to perform his magic
rites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>Each day has its special and peculiar ritual. Sunday
is the day for the “Works of Light,” and on this day
a purple robe should be worn and a tiara and bracelets
of gold; the ring placed on the finger of the operator
should be of gold and set with a chrysolite or a ruby.
A white robe with silver stripes is to be worn on Monday,
the day of the “Works of Divination and Mystery,” and
the high-priest of the mysteries wears over his robe a
triple necklace of pearls, “crystals,” and selenites; the
tiara should be covered with yellow silk, and bear in
silver characters the Hebrew monogram of Gabriel, as
given by Cornelius Agrippa in his “Occult Philosophy.”
Tuesday is assigned to the “Works of Wrath,” and on
this day the robe must be red, the color of fire and blood,
with a belt and bracelets of steel; the tiara should have
a circlet of iron, and a sword or a stylus is to be used
in place of a wand; the ring is set with an amethyst. The
day for the “Works of Science” is Wednesday, when a
green robe is worn and a necklace of hollow glass beads,
filled with quicksilver; the ring is adorned with an agate.
On Thursday, appointed for the “Works of Religion or
Politics,” a scarlet robe is worn; upon the forehead of
the operator is bound a plate of tin, engraved with the
symbol of the planet Jupiter and various mystic characters;
the ring bears either an emerald or a sapphire.
Friday, the day of Venus, is naturally dedicated to the
“Works of Love,” and the celebrant wears a sky-blue
robe; his ring shows a turquoise, and his tiara is set with
lapis-lazuli and beryl. The “Works of Mourning” belong
to Saturday, when a black or a brown robe is worn,
embroidered in orange-colored silk with mystic characters;
from the neck of the operator hangs a leaden
medal, bearing the symbol of the planet Saturn, and on
his finger is a ring set with an onyx, upon which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
double-faced Janus has been engraved while Saturn was
in the ascendant.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">X</a><br />

<small>Planetary and Astral Influences of Precious
Stones</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE talismanic influence of the stones associated with
the planets and also with the signs of the zodiac is
closely connected with the early ideas regarding the
formation of precious stones. In an old work on the
occult properties of gems we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The nature of the magnet is in the iron, and the nature of the
iron is in the magnet, and the nature of both polar stars is in both
iron and magnet, and hence the nature of the iron and the magnet
is also in both polar stars, and since they are Martian, that is to say,
their region belongs to Mars, so do both iron and magnet belong to
Mars.</p></blockquote>

<p>The author then proceeds to describe an analogous
relation between a man and any natural object or product
to which his imagination draws him, and shows that, if
this object be one that stands in a sympathetic relation
with the star beneath which the man was born, the man,
the star, and the object will constitute a triplicity of
great utility. As an explanation of the peculiarly intimate
relation between stars and precious stones we read,
on page 12:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Metals and precious stones usually lie with their first seeds deep
down in the earth and require continuous moisture and a mild heat.
This they obtain through a reflection of the sun and the other
stars in the manifold movement of the heavens.... Therefore,
also, the metals and precious stones are nearest related to the planets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
and the stars, since these influence them most potently and produce
their peculiar qualities, for they are enduring and unchangeable and
show therein their concordance [with the stars and the planets].<a id="FNanchor_441_441" href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hence it is that the influence over human fortunes
ascribed by astrology to the heavenly bodies is conceived
to be strengthened by wearing the gem appropriate to
certain planets or signs, for a subtle emanation has
passed into the stone and radiates from it. A combination
of several different stones, each partaking of this
special quality, was believed to have an influence similar
to that exercised by several planets in conjunction,—that
is, grouped in the same “house” or division of the
heavens.</p>

<p>The same is true of the stones dedicated to the guardian
angels; the color and appearance of the stone was
not merely emblematic of the angel, but, by its sympathetic
quality, it was supposed to attract his influence
and to provide a medium for the transmission of his
beneficent force to the wearer. The whole theory,
whether consciously or unconsciously, rested on the idea
of harmony, of the accord of certain ethereal vibrations,
either those of the visible light of the stars and planets
or the purely psychic emanations from the spiritual
“powers and principalities.”</p>

<p>The wearing of the appropriate zodiacal gem was
always believed to strengthen the influence of the zodiacal
sign upon those born under it, and to afford a sympathetic
medium for the transmission of the stellar influences.
The gem was thus something more than a mere
symbol of the sign. The same was true of the stone of
the saint who ruled the month and that of the holy guar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>dian
angel set over those born in the month. In each and
every case the material form and color of the stone was
believed to attract the favor and grace of the saint or
angel, who would see in the selection of the appropriate
gem an act of respect and veneration on the part of the
wearer.</p>

<p>The old writers are never tired of insisting upon the
idea that, while the image graven upon a stone was in
itself dead and inactive, the influence of the stars during
whose ascendancy the work had been executed communicated
to the inert material talismanic qualities and
virtues which it before lacked. In these instances the
images could be regarded as outward and visible signs
of the planetary or zodiacal influence. Even in the case
of the bezoar stone, a generally recognized antidote for
all sorts of poisons, it was held that the scorpion’s bite
could be most effectually healed by a bezoar upon which
this creature’s figure had been cut during the time when
the constellation Scorpio was in the ascendancy.<a id="FNanchor_442_442" href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p>In the production of engraved stones to serve as amulets,
the influence of the respective planet was made to
enter the stone by casting upon the latter, during the
process of engraving, reflections from a mirror which
had been exposed to the planet’s rays. In addition to
this, the work was executed while the planet was in the
ascendant, and the design was emblematic of it. With
these combined influences the gem was believed to be
thoroughly impregnated with the planetary virtue.<a id="FNanchor_443_443" href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>An old writer finds in the hardness of precious stones
a reason for their retaining longer the celestial virtues
they receive. After they have been extracted these vir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>tues
persist in them and they keep “the traces and gifts
of mundane life which they possessed while clinging to
the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_444_444" href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> These “gifts of mundane life” signify the
stored-up energy derived from the stars and planets,
which penetrates the matter of the stone, and each stone
is peculiarly sensitive to the emanations from a certain
planet, star, or group of stars.</p>

<p>A fine carnelian gem engraved with a design consisting
of a star surrounded by the images of a ram, a bull,
and a lion, is described by M. Mairan.<a id="FNanchor_445_445" href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> He sees in the
star the emblem of the splendid comet which appeared
shortly after the assassination of Cæsar, and which, according
to Suetonius, was believed to be the soul of
Cæsar newly received into the sky; the ram, bull, and
lion are the symbols of the zodiacal signs Aries, Taurus,
and Leo, the first-named sign referring perhaps to the
death of Cæsar on the Ides, or fifteenth of March; while
the other two signs may allude to the position of the
comet at different dates.</p>

<p>In the Cabinet du Roi, in Paris, there was an engraved
carnelian, the design showing Jupiter enthroned,
with thunderbolt and sceptre, and Mars and Mercury
standing on either side of the central figure. Separated
from the gods of the upper air by a bow, probably representing
the arch of the sky, appears the bust of Neptune,
emerging from the sea. The border of the design is
formed by the twelve signs of the zodiac, Virgo being of
an unusual type,—the virgin and a unicorn,—said to
have been used only during the reign of Domitian (81-96
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_446_446" href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>Some choice examples of astrological gems may be
seen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York;
among these is a green jasper bearing symbols of Luna,
Capricorn, and Taurus. This gem is from the collection
of the late Rev. C. W. King, which has been acquired for
the Museum, and is described as figuring the horoscope
of the owner. In the same collection is a banded agate
engraved with Sagittarius as a centaur, surrounded by
the stars of this constellation in their proper order.
King states that this was the earliest horoscopical gem
known to him. Still another gem of this collection is a
sard bearing the symbol of Aries carrying a long caduceus;
this type appears on the coins of Antioch, because
that city was founded in the month over which the sign
Aries presides.<a id="FNanchor_447_447" href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<p>The Austrian Imperial Collection in Vienna contains
the celebrated Gemma Augustea, sometimes called the
Apotheosis of Augustus. This commemorates the Pannonian
triumph of Tiberius, 13 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and above the figure
of Augustus appears the sign of Capricornus, the constellation
of his nativity; beneath the figure of Tiberius
is engraved the sign of Scorpio, under which that emperor
was born. This celebrated cameo, the work of the
famous gem-engraver Dioskorides, is mentioned in an
inventory of the treasury of St. Sernin, in Toulouse,
dated 1246. It is said to have been offered by Francis I
of France to Pope Clement VII, on the occasion of their
meeting in Marseilles in 1535; however, as the gem
only reached Marseilles two days after the pope’s departure,
Francis decided to retain possession of it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
royal treasure at Fontainebleau was plundered in 1590,
and the stone was offered for sale, and was purchased,
in 1619, by Emperor Rudolph II, for the sum of 12,000

<div class="caption">THE ZODIACAL STONES WITH THEIR SIGNS.</div>
</div>

<p><small>Old print illustrating the influence believed to be exerted on the different parts of the body by
the respective zodiacal signs, and through their power by the stones associated with them. This
belief often determined the administration of special precious-stone remedies by physicians of the
seventeenth and earlier centuries.</small></p>

<p>A ruby called sandastros is described by Pliny as
containing stellated bodies which he compares to the
Hyades; hence, says he, they are the objects of great devotion
with the Chaldæi or Assyrian Magi. According
to Morales (De las piedras preciosas), the ruby
and the diamond were both under the influence of the
sign of Taurus; the same writer informs us that the
Hyades and the sun were supposed to have a potent
effect upon the ruby or carbuncle. In ancient Babylonia
the sign of Taurus was regarded as the most important,
and Winckler believes that the presence in this sign of
the five stars of the Hyades and the seven of the Pleiades
was brought into connection with the twelve-fold division
of the zodiac. The Hyades signified the five signs visible
in Babylonia at the summer solstice, while the Pleiades
typified the seven invisible signs. It seems probable
that the Pleiades were associated with the diamond,
although Morales, who was very familiar with the
Moorish astrology current among the Spaniards of his
time, attributed the crystal to this group. His attribution
proves at least that the stone of the Pleiades was a
colorless one.</p>

<p>In Sanskrit the diamond is called <i>vajra</i>, “thunderbolt,”
and also <i>indrâjudha</i>, “Indra’s weapon”; another
name is <i>açira</i>, “fire,” or “the Sun.”<a id="FNanchor_448_448" href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> All these designations
are probably suggested by the brilliant flashes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
light emitted by this stone. It is not easy to determine
the reason that induced the Hindus to dedicate the diamond
to the planet Venus rather than to the Sun or to the
Moon. However, as the most brilliant of the planets,
Venus was not unworthy of the honor, and if we substitute
the Goddess of Love for her planet, it seems quite
appropriate that she should be adorned with the most
brilliant of precious stones. Certainly these sparkling
gems are often enough offered at the shrine of Venus in
our own day, and they often serve to win the good graces
of the divinity to whom they are presented.</p>

<p>The Sanskrit name for the sapphire, <i>nîla</i>, signifies
“blue,” so that, as the topaz is the “yellow stone” <i lang="la">par
excellence</i>, the sapphire is the blue stone (<i>nilaçman</i>). In
both cases the name indicates a variety of corundum, distinguished
merely by the coloring matter. As a talisman
the Hindus believed that the sapphire rendered the
planet Saturn favorable to the wearer, an important consideration
from the astrological point of view, for
Saturn’s influence was generally supposed to be unfavorable.
The Hindus distinguished four classes of
sapphires, corresponding to the four castes: Brahmins,
Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras. The respective sapphires
were light blue, reddish blue, yellowish blue, and
dark blue. The same distinction is made in the case of
the diamond, and a like rule applies to both stones,
namely, that only the appropriate stone should be worn
by the members of each caste, in order to profit by the
virtues inherent in the sapphire or diamond.<a id="FNanchor_449_449" href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>One of the Sanskrit appellations of the hyacinth
(zircon) is <i>râhuratna</i>,—that is, the jewel dedicated to
the mysterious “dragon,” that was supposed to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
cause of the periodic eclipses of the Sun and Moon.<a id="FNanchor_450_450" href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
As the stone was sacred to this malevolent influence, we
need not be surprised that it was believed to avert misfortune,
for nothing was so effective against the lesser
spirits of evil as an evil genius of great power.</p>

<p>According to the Hindu mystics it was very lucky
to have a turquoise at hand at the time of the new moon,
for whoever, after first looking at the moon on the
<i>pratipada</i> (the first day after new-moon), should cast
his eyes upon a turquoise, was destined to enjoy immeasurable
wealth.<a id="FNanchor_451_451" href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>An old Spanish list of the gems of the zodiacal signs
differs from those given above, and probably represents
Arab tradition:<a id="FNanchor_452_452" href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></p>


<ul class="lsmall"><li>Aries—Crystal</li>
<li>Taurus—Ruby and diamond</li>
<li>Gemini—Sapphire</li>
<li>Cancer—Agate and beryl</li>
<li>Leo—Topaz</li>
<li>Virgo—Magnet</li>
<li>Libra—Jasper</li>
<li>Scorpio—Garnet</li>
<li>Sagittarius—Emerald</li>
<li>Capricorn—Chalcedony</li>
<li>Aquarius—Amethyst</li>
<li>Pisces—</li></ul>


<p>Of planetary stones<a id="FNanchor_453_453" href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> there is assigned to the sun
the jacinth and the chrysolite, when this latter name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
was applied to the yellow Brazilian chrysoberyl, while
the moon controls the beryl, the rock-crystal and also the
pearl. To the share of Venus fall the sapphire and carbuncle
as well as coral and pearl; usually the emerald
is the stone of Venus. Mars lays claim to the diamond,
jacinth, and ruby, the last-named stone according with
the ruddy hue of our neighbor planet. Under the control
of Jupiter are placed the emerald, sapphire, amethyst,
and turquoise, so that this planet has the richest
assortment of gems; it will be remarked that the celestial
sapphire unites the influence of Venus and Jupiter,
the two especially propitious planets. Lastly, far-away
Saturn must be content with all dark, black, and brittle
stones; there was, indeed, little inducement to wear a
Saturnian stone, for the influence of this cold and distant
planet was always regarded as baleful.</p>

<p>The planetary controls of precious stones as given in
the Lapidario of Alfonso X, according to “Chaldaic”
tradition, show that the same stone was influenced in
many or most cases by more than one of the “seven
planets” (including the Sun and Moon). Thus the diamond,
belonging to the first degree of the sign Taurus,
was dominated by both Saturn and the Sun; the emerald
was controlled by Jupiter, and also by Mercury and by
Venus. The red jargoon was influenced by Mars, the
yellow variety by Jupiter and the white jargoon by
Venus. The carnelian received virtue from the Sun and
from Venus. The ruby, although more especially a sunstone,
came as well under the influence of the Planet of
Love. Coral belonged both to Venus and to the moon,
while lapis-lazuli and chalcedony only owed allegiance
to Venus; this planet also lent virtue to the beryl.<a id="FNanchor_454_454" href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<p>Among the Mohammedans, six of the seven heavens
were supposed to be made of precious substances:
the first was of emerald; the second, of white silver; the
third, of large white pearls; the fourth, of ruby; the
fifth, of red gold; and the sixth, of jacinth. The seventh
and highest heaven, however, was of shining light.<a id="FNanchor_455_455" href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
Here we have the three precious colored stones, emerald,
ruby, and sapphire (jacinth), to which is added the pearl.</p>

<p>The scarcity of the diamond in early times, and its
comparative lack of brilliancy before the invention of
rose and brilliant cutting, account for the absence of this
king of gems.</p>

<p>Rabelais,<a id="FNanchor_456_456" href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> describing the temple of the oracle of the
“Dive Bouteille,” says that of its seven columns the
first was of sapphire; the second, of jacinth; the third,
of “dyamant”; the fourth, of the “male” balas-ruby;
the fifth, of emerald, “more brilliant and glistening than
were those which were set in place of eyes in the marble
lion stretched before the tomb of King Hermias”; the
sixth column was of agate, and the seventh of transparent
selenite, “with a splendor like that of Hymettian
honey, and within appeared the moon in form and motion
such as she is in the heavens, full and new, waxing and
waning.” We are then told that these stones were attributed
to the seven planets by the Chaldæans, as
follows:</p>

<p>These manifold influences exerted by the stars and
planets through the medium of the gems, not only concerned
those actually present in a material form, but also
those that were seen in dreams, and interpretations of
such dreams are given by old writers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">STATUETTE KNOWN AS THAT OF SAINTE FOY, IN THE ABBEY-CHURCH
AT CONQUES, DEPT. AVEYRON, FRANCE.</div>
</div>
<p><small>It is studded with precious and semi-precious stones and engraved gems, dating from
various epochs, the pious offerings of those whose prayers have been answered. The figure
is 85 cm. (33½ inches) high and is of gold in a core of wood. Probably of the tenth century.
Two of the four crystal balls adorning the seat are said to replace golden doves. Rock-crystal
was especially dedicated to the moon.</small></p>

<p>Many Oneirocritica, or “dream-books,” were written
or compiled in the early centuries of our era, one of the
most noted being the work of Artemidorus, who flourished
in the second century <span class="smacap lowercase">A.D.</span> Every object seen in
a dream was given a special meaning, and it is interesting
to note that Artemidorus believed dreams of rings
or other ornaments, as well as of precious stones, to be
of favorable significance only for women. Such dreams
indicated marriage for unmarried women, and the birth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
of children for those already married. If a woman was
both wife and mother when she saw sparkling jewels in
her dream, then the vision portended the acquisition of
great wealth. Artemidorus here sagely remarks that
women are by nature devoted to riches and passionately
fond of ornaments. For men, on the other hand, to
dream of jewels was an ill omen; probably because it
foreshadowed the necessity of buying them for a good
friend or a faithful wife.<a id="FNanchor_462_462" href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<p>Another of these dream-books, probably composed in
the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, appears under the name of Achametis
and is of Arabic origin. Many of the interpretations
in this book are referred to a Hindu source, and
among these are visions of crowns that appear to kings.
Such a dream, in itself, usually portended increased
power and success for the sovereign, but this depended
upon the color and character of the jewels which adorned
the crown. For example, we read that if the gems were
red and of the kind known as lychnites (carbuncles or
rubies), the dream indicated that the king would have
great joy and good fortune and would be more feared
by his enemies than before; but if he saw blue gems in
the crown, it was a bad omen, foreshadowing the loss of
part of his kingdom. If the stones were of a light green
hue (the color of the leek), the king would gain a great
name in the world, both by his good faith and by the
greatness of his kingdom; for, the writer adds, “this
color in precious stones is universally accepted as signifying
good-faith and religious devotion to God.”<a id="FNanchor_463_463" href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p>If precious stones be so combined in a ring, or other
jewel that the initial letters of their names spell words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
significant of a tender sentiment or implying good fortune,
or else the name of someone dear to the giver of the
jewel, this is also supposed to strengthen their astral or
planetary influence and to render them more potent
charms. In the following examples the gems in the first

column being comparatively inexpensive ones.</p>


<h3>ACROSTICS FORMED WITH STONES</h3>

<p>In France and England, during the 18th century,
rings, bracelets, brooches, etc., were often set with gems
the first letters of which, combined, formed a motto or
expressed a sentiment. The following is a list of those
that may be used in this way. The choice of stones
afforded here brings these pretty devices within the reach
of all.</p>

<p>An attractive engagement ring can be formed of a
central diamond from which extend the rays of a five-pointed
star. Between the rays are set the stones emblematic
of the zodiacal sign, of the guardian angel of
the month, of the planet control of the hour and also the
two stones indicating the initial letter of the two Christian
names. This ring is in the form of the mystic
Pentagon, the grand symbol of constancy and durability,
since the number five is composed of three, which signifies
creative power, and two, which typifies the balance,
that is, stability.</p>

<p>As, according to the old fancy, the influences due to
the light emanations from the planets or fixed stars, or
from the combination of the stars in a zodiacal sign, would
have a peculiar and more or less intimate connection with
the fate of one country rather than of another, an attempt
is here made to give a characteristic stone for each country.
In the case of the United States the various gem-stones
found within the boundaries of each of the States
of the Union are given. That this special influence was
exceptionally potent in regard to those born in the countries
in question was also taught and hence a national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
gem would have a greater talismanic power than any
other for the natives of each separate country. For
those who may feel a certain degree of sympathy for
time-honored fancies, and who may perhaps also have
a trace of superstition hidden away in some part of their
consciousness, one of our State gems would have a similar
significance.</p>

<small>On the Therapeutic Use of Precious and Semi-Precious
Stones</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap first-letter">THE medicinal use of precious stones may be traced
back to very ancient times. It has been conjectured
that their employment for such purposes was introduced
to Europe from India, whence many of the stones were
derived. Nevertheless, the earliest evidence we have
rather points to Egypt as the source, and, indeed, it appears
that in early Egyptian times the chemical constituents
of the stones were much more rationally considered
than at a later period in Europe. The Ebers Papyrus,
for instance, recommends the use of certain astringent
substances, such as lapis-lazuli, as ingredients of eye-salves,
and hematite, an iron oxide, was used for checking
hemorrhages and for reducing inflammations. Little by
little, however, superstition associated certain special
virtues with the color and quality of precious stones,
and their virtues were thought to be greatly enhanced
by engraving on them the image of some god, or of some
object symbolizing certain of the activities of nature.
Later still, the science of astrology, most highly developed
in Assyria and Babylonia, was brought into combination
with the various superstitions above indicated, so
that the image was believed to have much greater efficacy
if the engraving were executed when the sun was in a
certain constellation or when the moon or some one of
the planets was in the ascendant at the time.</p>

<p>If we exclude certain fragmentary notices in Egyp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>tian
literature—notably the statements in the Ebers
Papyrus—and the very uncertain sources in Hindu literature,
the earliest authority for this branch of the subject
is the Natural History of Pliny. In this connection, however,
it is only just to call attention to a fact which has
been often ignored—namely, that Pliny himself had very
little faith in the teachings of the “magi,” as he calls
them, in regard to the superstitious use of gems for the
prevention or cure of diseases; indeed, he seems to have
been almost as sceptical in his attitude as many modern
writers, for certain quite recent authorities still credit
amber and a few other mineral substances with therapeutic
effects other than those which can be explained by
the known action of their chemical constituents. Still,
Pliny yielded so far to the taste of his time as to preserve
for us many of the statements of earlier writers on the
subject, naming them in most cases and so enabling us to
form some idea of the character of this pseudo-science in
the Roman world in the first century of our era. With
the gradual decay of ancient learning, the less valuable
elements of popular belief came more and more into the
foreground, and the old superstitions were freely copied
by successive authors, each of whom felt called upon to
add something new on his own account. This explains
much of the confusion that reigns in regard to the attribution
of special virtues to the different stones, for the
wider the reading of the author the greater became the
number of virtues attributed to each separate stone, until,
at last, we might almost say that each and every precious
stone could be used for the cure of all diseases. Nevertheless,
it is comparatively easy to see that either the
color or constitution of the stone originally indicated its
use for this or that disease.</p>

<p><small>It dates from about 1600 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, the period of the Ebers Papyrus, and gives directions for
preparing certain remedies from precious stones. While the interpretation of this text
offers considerable difficulty, one version finds in it the statement that lapis-lazuli—the
“sapphire” of the ancients—was used for the wealthy, and malachite for those of limited
means. Professor Oefele conjectures that the disease to be treated was hysteria. Munch
Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.</small></p>

<p>A distinction is often made between the talismanic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
qualities of precious stones for the cure or prevention
of disease and the properly medicinal use of them as
mineral substances. In the former case the effect was
attained by merely wearing them on the person, while
in the latter case they were reduced to a powder, which
was dissolved as far as possible in water or some other
liquid and then taken internally. As, however, the end
to be attained is the same whether the stone be worn or
taken internally as a powder or liquid, it seems more
logical to treat of both these methods of therapeutic use
together, reserving for the chapter on the talismanic use
of gems only their employment to avert misfortunes
other than those caused by disease, and their influence
in the procuring of wealth, honors, and happiness for
their wearers.</p>

<p>The belief in the curative properties of precious stones
was at one time universal among all those to whom gems
were known. When we read to-day of the various ills
that were supposed to be cured by the use of these gems,
we find it difficult to understand what process of thought
could have suggested the idea of employing such ineffectual
remedies. It is true that the constituents of certain
stones can be absorbed by the human body and have
a definite effect upon it, but the greater part of the elements
are so combined that they cannot be assimilated,
and they pass through the system without producing any
apparent effect.</p>

<p>In ancient and medieval times, however, other than
chemical agencies were supposed to be efficient in the cure
of diseases, and the primitive animistic conception of the
cause of illness, and hence of the therapeutics of disease,
long held sway among those who practised the medical
art. Remedies were prized because of their rarity, and
also because it was believed that certain spiritual or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
planetary influences had aided in their production and
were latent in them. Besides this, the symbolism of color
played a very important part in recommending the use
of particular stones for special diseases. This may be
noted in the case of the red or reddish stones, such as
the ruby, spinel, garnet, carnelian, bloodstone, etc. These
were thought to be sovereign remedies for hemorrhages
of all kinds, as well as for all inflammatory diseases;
they were also believed to exercise a calming influence
and to remove anger and discord. The red hue of these
stones was supposed to indicate their fitness for such
use, upon the principle <i lang="la">similia similibus curantur</i>. In the
same way yellow stones were prescribed for the cure of
bilious disorders, for jaundice in all its forms and for
other diseases of the liver.</p>

<p>The use of green stones to relieve diseases of the
eye was evidently suggested by the beneficial influence
exerted by this color upon the sight. The verdant
emerald represented the beautiful green fields, upon
which the tired eye rests so willingly, and which exert
such a soothing influence upon the sight when it has been
unduly strained or fatigued. One of the earliest, probably
the very earliest reference in Greek writings to the
therapeutic value of gems, appears in the works of Theophrastus,
who wrote in the third century before Christ.
Here we are told of the beneficial effect exercised by the
emerald upon the eyes.</p>

<p>The sapphire, the lapis-lazuli, and other blue stones,
with a hue resembling the blue of the heavens, were believed
to exert a tonic influence, and were supposed to
counteract the wiles of the spirits of darkness and procure
the aid and favor of the spirits of light and wisdom.
These gems were usually looked upon as emblems of
chastity, and for this reason the sapphire came to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
regarded as especially appropriate for use in ecclesiastical
rings. Among purple stones, the amethyst is particularly
noteworthy. The well-known belief that this
gem counteracted the effects of undue indulgence in intoxicating
beverages is indicated by its name, derived
from μεθύω—“to be intoxicated,” and the privative α,
the name thus signifying the “sobering” gem. It is not
unlikely that a fancied resemblance between the prevailing
hue of these stones and that of certain kinds of
wine first gave rise to the name and to the idea of the
peculiar virtues of the amethyst.</p>

<p>We have mentioned only a few of the more obvious
analogies suggested by the color of gems, and we might
be tempted to cite many others were it not that symbolism
is always treacherous ground, since there is practically
no limit to the correspondences that may be found between
sensuous impressions and ideas.</p>

<p>One great difficulty which besets any one who is trying
to find a clue to guide him through the labyrinth of
the medical affinities of gems is the fact that there was,
from an early period, a tendency to attribute the virtues
of one gem to another, probably owing to the commercial
instinct which urged the dealer to praise his wares in
every possible way, so that no part of his stock should
fail to find a purchaser. This tendency is especially
marked in the old Hindu Lapidaries, wherein it is almost
impossible to find any differentiation of the stones in
respect to their curative or talismanic virtues. Only the
condition and perfection of the gems are made the criterion
of their worth. Any given stone, if perfect, was a
source of all blessings to the wearer and possessed all
remedial powers, while a defective stone, or one lacking
the proper lustre or color, was destined to be a source of
untold misfortune to the owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>The European writers on the medical properties of
precious stones were influenced by quite different considerations;
their chief aim was to represent each stone,
regarded simply as a mineral substance, as being the
abode of the greatest possible number of curative properties.
Indeed, many of the most highly recommended
electuaries contained all kinds of stones, as though the
effect to be produced did not depend upon the qualities
of any single stone, or class of stones, but rather upon
the quantity used. In Arnobio’s “Tesoro delle Gioie,”<a id="FNanchor_464_464" href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>
we have a receipt for the composition of “the most noble
electuary of jacinth.” This contains jacinth, emerald,
sapphire, topaz, garnet, pearl, ruby, white and red coral,
and amber, as well as many animal and vegetable substances,
in all, thirty-four ingredients. It would indeed
seem that a good dose of such a mixture should have
provided a cure for “all the ills that flesh is heir to,” by
the simple and effective means of removing the unhappy
patient to a better world.</p>

<p>Treating of the metallic affinities of precious stones,
Paracelsus (1493-1541) affirmed that the emerald was a
copper stone; the carbuncle and the jasper were golden
stones; the ruby and the chalcedony, silver stones. The
“white sapphire” (corundum) was a stone of Jupiter,
while the jacinth was a mercurial stone. Powdered
jacinth mixed with an equal quantity of laudanum was
recommended as a remedy for fevers resulting from
“putrefaction of the air or water.” This illustrates
the custom of combining an inefficacious material, such
as the powder of a precious stone, with another possessing
genuine remedial virtue, the name of the stone appealing
to the popular superstitions regarding its thera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>peutic
powers, and thus rendering the preparation more
acceptable.<a id="FNanchor_465_465" href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<p>It is related by Plutarch that when Pericles was dying
of the plague, he showed to one of his friends, who was
visiting him, an amulet suspended from his neck. This
had been given to Pericles by the women of his household,
and Plutarch cites the instance as a proof that even
the strongest minds will at certain times yield to the
influence of superstition.<a id="FNanchor_466_466" href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></p>

<p>There were sceptics in ancient times who put no faith
in the popular superstitions as to the curative powers
of precious stones. Eusebius (ca. 264-ca. 349), in his
oration on the Emperor Constantine the Great (272-337),
says:<a id="FNanchor_467_467" href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>He held that the varieties of stones so greatly admired were useless
and ineffective things. They possessed no other qualities than their
natural ones, and hence no efficacy to hold evils aloof; for what power
can such things have either to cure disease or to avert death? Nevertheless,
although he well knew this, he was in no wise opposed to
their use simply as ornaments by his subjects.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Middle High German didactic poem on precious
stones, composed by Volmar, or Volamar, about 1250,
appears to have been written as a rejoinder to a satirical
poem, the work of a writer called the “Stricker” (rascal).
What chiefly aroused Volmar’s wrath was the fact that
this irreverent personage dared to assert that a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
colored glass set in a ring looked just as well and possessed
the same virtues as a genuine precious stone of the
same color. Volmar does not mince matters, and roundly
declares that whoever should kill the man who wrote
thus would do no sinful act. While we can scarcely recommend
such drastic action, we must admit that we feel
a little sympathy with the medieval champion of genuine
stones against imitations.</p>

<p>A most interesting item recording one phase of a
great tyrant’s character is reported by Sir Jerome Horsey,
who was entrusted with messages to and from Elizabeth
of England and Ivan the Terrible of Russia. He
gives, in his “Travels,” a graphic recital of an interview
with Ivan just before the latter’s death in 1584. We retain
the archaic spelling as it is reproduced in the Hakluyt
publication from the original manuscript. Writing
of Ivan, Horsey says:<a id="FNanchor_468_468" href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The load-stone you all know hath great and hidden vertue, without

Johannes Lloff, to scrape a circle thereof upon the tabell; putt within
it one spider and so one other and died, and some other without that
ran alive apace from it.—“It is too late, it will not preserve me.
Behold these precious stones. This diomond is the orients richest and
most precious of all other. I never affected it; yt restreyns furie and
luxurie and abstinacie and chasticie; the least parcell of it in powder
will poysen a horse geaven to drinck, much more a man.” Poynts at
the ruby. “Oh! this is most comfortable to the hart, braine, vigar and
memorie of man, clarifies congelled and corrupt bloud.”—Then at the
emerald.—“The natur of the reyn-bowe; this precious stone is an
enemye to uncleanness. The saphier I greatlie delight in; yt preserves
and increaseth courage, joies the hart, pleasinge to all the vitall sensis,
precious and verie soveraigne for the eys, clears the sight, takes awaye
bloudshott and streingthens the mussells and strings thereof.”—Then
takes the onex in hand.—“All these are Gods wonderfull guifts,
secreats in natur, and yet revells [reveals] them to mans use and contemplacion,
as frendes to grace and vertue and enymies to vice. I
fainte, carie me awaye till an other tyme.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Some believed that when precious stones were worn
to relieve or prevent disease, it was important that the
different stones should be worn on different parts of the
body. According to one authority, the jacinth should be
worn on the neck; the diamond, on the left arm; the sapphire,
on the ring-finger; the emerald, or the jacinth, on
the index-finger; and the ruby or turquoise, on either the
index-finger or the little finger.<a id="FNanchor_470_470" href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> There is, however, little
reason to assume that these rules were generally known
and observed.</p>

<p>That precious stones not only appealed to the eye by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
their beautiful colors, but also possessed a fragrant odor,
was one of the many fanciful ideas regarding them. If
we could believe the following circumstantial account,
this was once experimentally proved:<a id="FNanchor_471_471" href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>When precious stones are to be used in medicine, they must be
pulverized until they are reduced to a powder so fine that it will not
grate under the teeth, or, in the words of Galen, this powder must
be as impalpable “as that which is blown into the eyes.” Since this
trituration is not usually operated with sufficient care by the apothecaries,
I begged a medical student, who was lodging with me, to pass
an entire month in grinding some of these stones. I gave him
emeralds, jacinths, sapphires, rubies, and pearls, an ounce of each
kind. As these stones were rough and whole, he first crushed them a
little in a well-polished iron mortar, using a pestle of the same metal;
afterward he employed a pestle and mortar of glass, devoting several
hours each day to this work. At the end of about three weeks, his
room, which was rather large, became redolent with a perfume, agreeable
both from its variety and sweetness. This odor, which much
resembled that of March violets, lingered in the room for more than
three days. There was nothing in the room to produce it, so that it
certainly proceeded from the powder of precious stones.</p></blockquote>


<h3 class="h3l">Diamond</h3>

<p>Of the many medicinal virtues attributed to the diamond,
one of the most noteworthy is that of an antidote
for poisons. Strangely enough, the belief in its efficacy
in this respect was coupled with the idea that the stone
in itself was a deadly poison. The origin of this latter
fancy must be sought in the tradition that the place
wherein the diamonds were generated—“in the land
where it is six months day and six months night”—was
guarded by venomous creatures who, in passing over the
stones, were wounded by the sharp points of the crystals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
and thus embued the stones with some of their venom.<a id="FNanchor_472_472" href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a>
The attribution of curative properties in case of poisoning
arose from association of ideas. The Lapidario of
Alfonso X recommends the diamond for diseases of the
bladder; it adds, however, that this stone should be used
only in desperate cases.</p>

<p>The diamond was also believed to afford protection
from plague or pestilence, and a proof of its powers in
this direction was found in the fact that the plague first
attacked the poorer classes, sparing the rich, who could
afford to adorn themselves with diamonds. Naturally,
in common with other precious stones, this brilliant gem
was supposed to cure many diseases. Marbodus<a id="FNanchor_473_473" href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> tells
us that it was even a cure for insanity.</p>

<p>In the Babylonian Talmud we read of a marvellous
precious stone belonging to Abraham. This was perhaps
a diamond, or possibly a pearl; the accounts vary, and
the same word is often used to designate “precious stone”
and “pearl.” The following version represents it to be
a diamond:<a id="FNanchor_474_474" href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>R. Simeon, ben Johanan said: “A diamond was hanging
on Abraham’s neck, and when a sick man looked upon
it he was cured. And when Abraham passed away, the
Lord sealed it in the planet of the sun.”</p>

<p>The Hindus believed that it was extremely dangerous
to use diamonds of inferior quality for curative purposes,
as they would not only fail to remedy the disease for
which they were prescribed, but might cause lameness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
jaundice, pleurisy, and even leprosy. As to the use of
diamonds of good quality, very explicit directions are
given. On some day regarded as auspicious for the
operation, the stone was to be dipped in the juice of the
<i>kantakára</i> (<i>Solanum jaquiri</i>) and subjected for a whole
night to the heat of a fire made by dried pieces of the
dung of a cow or of a buffalo. In the morning it was to
be immersed in cow’s urine and again subjected to fire.
These processes were to be repeated for seven days, at
the end of which term the diamond could be regarded as
purified. After this the stone was to be buried in a paste
of certain leguminous seeds mixed with asafœtida and
rock salt. Herein it was to be heated twenty-one successive
times, when it would be reduced to ashes. If
these ashes were then dissolved in some liquid, the potion
would “conduce to longevity, general development of the
body, strength, energy, beauty of complexion, and happiness,”
giving an adamantine strength to the limbs.<a id="FNanchor_475_475" href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></p>

<p>An Austrian nobleman, who for a long time had not
been able to sleep without having terrible dreams, was
immediately cured by wearing a small diamond set in
gold on his arm, so that the stone came in contact with
his skin.<a id="FNanchor_476_476" href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></p>

<p>The fact that in this case, as in many others, the stone
was required to touch the skin, proves that the effect
supposed to be produced was not altogether magical, but
in the nature of a physical emanation from the stone to
the body of the wearer.</p>

<p>We are told that when Pope Clement VII was seized
by his last illness, in 1534, his physicians resorted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
powders composed of various precious stones. In the
space of fourteen days they are asserted to have given
the pope forty thousand ducats’ worth of these stones,
a single dose costing as much as three thousand ducats.
The most costly remedy of all was a diamond administered
to him at Marseilles. Unfortunately, this lavish
expenditure was of no avail; indeed, according to our
modern science, the remedies might have sufficed to end
the pope’s life, without the help of his disease.<a id="FNanchor_477_477" href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>The old fancy that the diamond grew dark in the presence
of poison is explained by the Italian physician
Gonelli as caused by minute and tenuous particles which
emanated from the poison, impinged upon the surface of
the diamond, and, unable to penetrate its dense mass,
accumulated on the surface, thus producing a superficial
discoloration. The diamond, being a cold substance,
may have condensed moisture from the body, and the one
suffering from the poison may have emitted exudations.
But this elaborate explanation of a phenomenon which
never existed except in the imagination of those who
related it is characteristic of Gonelli, who was always
ready to elucidate in some similar way any of the marvels
recounted in regard to precious stones.<a id="FNanchor_478_478" href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Emerald</h3>

<p>The emerald was employed as an antidote for poisons
and for poisoned wounds, as well as against demoniacal
possession.<a id="FNanchor_479_479" href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> If worn on the neck it was said to cure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
“semitertian” fever and epilepsy.<a id="FNanchor_480_480" href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> The use of the
emerald to rest and relieve the eye is the only remedial
use of a precious stone mentioned by Theophrastus in his
treatise on gems, written in the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Alluding
to its powers as an antidote for poisons, Rueus asserts<a id="FNanchor_481_481" href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a>
that if the weight of eighty barley-corns of its
powder were given to one dying from the effects of
poison, the dose would save his life. The Arabs prized
emeralds highly for this purpose, and Abenzoar states
that, having once taken a poisonous herb, he placed an
emerald in his mouth and applied another to his stomach,
whereupon he was entirely cured.<a id="FNanchor_482_482" href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<p>A certain cure for dysentery also was to wear an
emerald suspended so that it touched the abdomen and
to place another emerald in the mouth. Michaele Paschali,
a learned Spanish physician of the sixteenth century,
declared that he had effected a cure of the disease
by means of the emerald in the case of Juan de Mendoza,
a Spanish grandee, and Wolfgang Gabelchover, of Calw,
in Würtemberg, writing in 1603, asserts that he had often
tested the virtues of the emerald in cases of dysentery
and with invariable success.<a id="FNanchor_483_483" href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></p>

<p>It speaks not a little for the beauty of the emerald that
so good a judge of precious stones as Pliny should have
pronounced this gem to be the only one that delighted the
eye without fatiguing it, adding that when the vision was
wearied by gazing intently at other objects, it gained
renewed strength by viewing an emerald. So general
in the early centuries of our era was the persuasion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the pure green hue of emeralds aided the eyesight, that
gem engravers are said to have kept some of them on
their work-tables, so as to be able to look at the stones
from time to time and thus relieve the eye-strain caused
by close application to their delicate task.<a id="FNanchor_484_484" href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></p>

<p>Psellus says that a cataplasm made of emeralds was
of help to those suffering from leprosy; he adds that if
pulverized and taken in water they would check hemorrhages.<a id="FNanchor_485_485" href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
They were especially commended for use as
amulets to be hung on the necks of children, as they
were believed to ward off and prevent epilepsy. If,
however, the violence of the disease was such that it
could not be overcome by the stone, the latter would
break.<a id="FNanchor_486_486" href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> Hermes Trismegistus says the emerald cures
ophthalmia and hemorrhages. The great Hermes must
have had a special preference for this stone, since his
treatise on chemistry (<i lang="la">peri chemeias</i>) is said to have
been found inscribed on an emerald.<a id="FNanchor_487_487" href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></p>

<p>By the Hindu physicians of the thirteenth century the
emerald was considered to be a good laxative. It cured
dysentery, diminished the secretion of bile, and stimulated
the appetite. In short, it promoted bodily health
and destroyed demoniacal influences. In the curious
phrase of the school the emerald was “cold and
sweet.”<a id="FNanchor_488_488" href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>Teifashi (1242 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) believed that the emerald was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
cure for hæmoptysis and for dysentery if it were worn
over the liver of the person affected; to cure gastric
troubles, the stone was to be laid upon the stomach.
Furthermore, the wearer was protected from the attacks
of venomous creatures, and evil spirits were driven from
the place where emeralds were kept.<a id="FNanchor_489_489" href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> The direction to
place the stone on the affected part, a recommendation
often met with in the treatises on the therapeutic use of
ornamental stones, shows that these were believed to send
forth emanations of subtle power. Probably enough, the
brilliant play of reflected light which proceeds from
many of these gems suggested the idea that they radiated
a certain curative energy. This theory need not surprise
us, for, although it is altogether fanciful in the case
of the diamond, ruby, emerald, etc., the newly discovered
substance, radium, really possesses the active properties
ascribed by old writers to precious stones.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Jade</h3>

<p>A stone the therapeutic quality of which was specialized
is the jade or nephrite. Strange to say, although
there are very few places where this mineral can now
be obtained,—the chief sources of supply being the province
of Khotan in Turkistan and New Zealand,—in prehistoric
times the stone must have been found in many
different localities, since axe-heads and other artefacts
of jade have been discovered in many lands both of the
old and new world.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards discovered and explored the
southern part of the American continent, they came
across numerous native ornaments and amulets made of
jade (jadeite) and brought many of these with them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
Europe. The name jade is derived from the Spanish
designation, <i lang="es">piedra de hijada</i>, meaning literally “stone
of the flank,” which is said to have been bestowed on the
stone because the Indians used it for all diseases of the
kidneys. The name nephrite owes its origin to the same
idea. In ancient times jade appears to have been looked
upon as a great aid in parturition, and many ingenious
conjectures have been advanced as to the connection between
this belief and the form of some of the prehistoric
objects made of this material. Whether the Spaniards
really learned from the Indians that the stone was especially
adapted to cure renal diseases, or whether they
only suggested this special and peculiar virtue in order
to give an enhanced value to their jade ornaments, is a
question not easily answered.</p>

<p>An early notice of jade as a remedial agent appears
in Sir Walter Raleigh’s account of his travels in Guiana.
Treating of a people of “Amazons” said to dwell in the
interior of the country, Raleigh says:<a id="FNanchor_490_490" href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>These Amazones have likewise great store of these plates of golde,
which they recover by exchange, chiefly for a kinde of greene stone,
which the Spaniards call Piedras Hijadas, and we use for spleene
stones and for the disease of the stone we also esteeme them: of these
I saw divers in Guiana, and commonly every King or <i>Casique</i> hath
one, which theire wives for the most part weare, and they esteeme them
as great jewels.</p></blockquote>

<p>By the middle of the seventeenth century the curative
powers of jade for the various forms of calculi was very
generally admitted. A singular instance is offered us in
one of Voiture’s letters. He was a great sufferer from
“the stone” and he had received, from a Mademoiselle
Paulet, a beautiful jade bracelet. Gratefully acknowl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>edging
the receipt of this peculiar gift, he expresses himself
in the following frank way, a mixture of indelicacy
and gallantry that seems strange to us: “If the stones
you have given me do not break mine, they will at least
make me bear my sufferings patiently; and it seems to
me that I ought not to complain of my colic, since it has
procured me this happiness.” The name used for jade
by Voiture, “<i>l’éjade</i>,” supplied a missing link in the
derivation of our name jade from the Spanish <i>hijada</i>.
When the lady’s gift was received by Voiture, some
friends chanced to be present, and they were disposed to
regard it as a token of love until he assured them that it
was only a remedy. It appears that Mlle. Paulet was a
fellow sufferer, and, alluding to this, Voiture writes:
“On this occasion the jade had for you an effect you did
not expect from it, and its virtue defended your own.”<a id="FNanchor_491_491" href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<p>Renal calculi and poetry do not seem to have much in
common, but the following lines freely rendered from
an old Italian poem on the subject by Ciri de Pers show
that even this unpromising theme is susceptible of poetic
treatment:<a id="FNanchor_492_492" href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>
<p>As jade was and still is the most favored stone in
China, although never found within the boundaries of
China proper, it was very naturally accorded wonderful
medical virtues. An old Chinese encyclopedia, the work
of Li She Chan, and presented by him to the emperor
Wan Lih of the Ming dynasty, in 1596, contains many
interesting notices of jade. When reduced to a powder
of the size of rice grains it strengthened the lungs, the
heart, and the vocal organs, and prolonged life, more
especially if gold and silver were added to the jade
powder. Another, and certainly a pleasanter way of
absorbing this precious mineral, was to drink what was
enthusiastically called the “divine liquor of jade.” To
concoct this elixir equal parts of jade, rice, and dew-water
were put into a copper pot and boiled, the resultant
liquid being carefully filtered. This mixture was
said to strengthen the muscles and make them supple,
to harden the bones, to calm the mind, to enrich the
flesh, and to purify the blood. Whoever took it for a
long space of time ceased to suffer from either heat or
cold and no longer felt either hunger or thirst.</p>

<p>Galen (b. ca. 130 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) wrote thus of the green
jasper:<a id="FNanchor_493_493" href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some have testified to a virtue in certain stones, and this is true
of the green jasper, that is to say, this stone aids the stomach and
navel by contact. And some, therefore, set the stone in rings and
engrave on it a dragon surrounded by rays, according to what King
Nechepsos has transmitted to posterity in the fourteenth book (of his
works). Indeed, I myself have thoroughly tested this stone, for I
hung a necklace composed of them about my neck so that they touched
the navel, and I received not less benefit from them than I would had
they borne the engraving of which Nechepsos wrote.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Ruby</h3>

<p>Sanskrit medical literature as represented by Naharari,
a physician of Cashmere, who wrote in the thirteenth
century, finds in the ruby a valuable remedy for
flatulency and biliousness. Moreover, aside from these
special uses, an elixir of great potency could be made
from rubies by those who properly understood the employment
of precious stones in the compounding of medicines.<a id="FNanchor_494_494" href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a>
This famous “ruby elixir” may have had little
in common with the stone except its color, as such remedies
were generally said to have been made by some
secret and mysterious process, in the course of which all
material evidence of the presence of any precious stone
or stones completely disappeared.</p>


<h3 class="h3l">Sapphire</h3>

<p>One of the earliest specimens of English literature,
William Langley’s “Vision of William concerning Piers
the Plowman” (written about 1377), contains a mention
of the sapphire as a cure for disease:<a id="FNanchor_495_495" href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></p>

<p>Among the rich gifts offered at the shrine of St.
Erkinwald, in Old Saint Paul’s, was a sapphire given in
1391 by Richard Preston, “a citizen and grocer of London.”
He stipulated that the stone should be kept at
the shrine for the cure of diseases of the eyes, and that
proclamation should be made of its remedial virtues. St.
Erkinwald was the son of Offa, King of the East Saxons,
and was converted to Christianity by Melittus, the first
bishop of London. In 675 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> he himself became bishop
of London, being the third to attain that rank after the
death of Melittus. His body was interred in the cathedral,
and his shrine, which was richly embellished during
the reign of Edward III (1327-1377), received many
valuable donations.<a id="FNanchor_502_502" href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></p>

<p>The usefulness of the sapphire as an eyestone for the
removal of all impurities or foreign bodies from the eye
is noted by Albertus Magnus, who writes that he had seen
it employed for this purpose. He adds that when a sapphire
was used in this way it should be dipped in cold
water both before and after the operation.<a id="FNanchor_503_503" href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> This was
probably not so much to make the stone colder to the
touch as to cleanse it, certainly a very necessary proceeding
when the same stone was used by many persons
suffering from contagious diseases of the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<p>Richard Preston’s sapphire appears to have been
only one of a class regarded as having special virtue to
cure diseased eyes, as is shown by the existence of various
other similar sapphires in different parts of Europe. It
is not very easy to determine the precise reason—if there
be one—which rendered any single sapphire more useful
than another in this respect. An entry in the inventory
of Charles V notes “an oval Oriental sapphire for touching
the eyes, set in a band of gold.”<a id="FNanchor_504_504" href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> Possibly the fact
that a particular gem of this kind was used remedially,
and was not set for wear as an ornament, may have been
the only cause for a belief in its special virtue.</p>

<p>That the sapphire should have been regarded as especially
valuable for the cure of eye diseases serves to illustrate
the wide-reaching and persistent influence of
Egyptian thought, and the curious transformations
through which an originally reasonable idea may pass in
the course of time. We have already noted that the
sapphire of the ancients was our lapis-lazuli, and in the
Ebers Papyrus lapis-lazuli is given as one of the ingredients
of an eye-wash. This ingredient is believed to have
originally been the oxide of copper sometimes called
lapis Armenus, a material possessing marked astringent
properties, and which might be used to advantage in certain
morbid conditions of the eye. Lapis-lazuli, another
blue stone, was later substituted because of its greater
intrinsic value, its similarity of color rendering it equally
efficacious according to primitive ideas on this subject.
When, however, in medieval times, the name sapphire
came to signify the blue corundum gem known to us by
this designation, the special curative virtues of the lapis-lazuli
were transferred to this still more valuable stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>The proper method of applying a sapphire to cure
plague boils is given at some length by Van Helmont. A
gem of a fine, deep color was to be selected and rubbed
gently and slowly around the pestilential tumor. During
and immediately after this operation, the patient would
feel but little alleviation; but a good while after the removal
of the stone, favorable symptoms would appear,
provided the malady were not too far advanced. This
Van Helmont attributes to a magnetic force in the sapphire
by means of which the absent gem continued to
extract “the pestilential virulency and contagious poyson
from the infected part.”<a id="FNanchor_505_505" href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>


<h3 class="h3l">Topaz</h3>

<p>The use of a topaz to cure dimness of vision is strongly
recommended by St. Hildegard. To attain the desired
end the stone was to be placed in wine and left there for
three days and three nights. When retiring to sleep, the
patient should rub his eyes with the moistened topaz, so
that this moisture lightly touched the eyeball. After the
stone had been removed, the wine could be used for five
days.<a id="FNanchor_506_506" href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></p>

<p>A Roman physician of the fifteenth century was reputed
to have wrought many wonderful cures of those
stricken by the plague, through touching the plague sores
with a topaz which had belonged to two popes, Clement
VI and Gregory II. The fact that this particular topaz
had been in the hands of two supreme pontiffs must have
added much to the faith reposed in the curative powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
of the stone by those upon whom it was used, and this
faith may really have helped to hasten their recovery.<a id="FNanchor_507_507" href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a></p>

<h3 class="h3l">Bloodstone</h3>

<p>A historical instance of the use of the bloodstone to
check a hemorrhage is recorded in the case of Giorgio
Vasari (1514-1578), the author of the lives of the Italian
painters of the Renaissance period. On a certain occasion,
when the painter Luca Signorelli (1439-1521) was
placing one of his pictures in a church at Arezzo, Vasari,
who was present, was seized with a violent hemorrhage
and fainted away. Without a moment’s hesitation, Signorelli
took from his pocket a bloodstone amulet and
slipped it down between Vasari’s shoulder-blades. The
hemorrhage is said to have ceased immediately.<a id="FNanchor_508_508" href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></p>

<p>The bloodstone was used as a remedy by the Indians
of New Spain, and Monardes notes that they often cut
the material into the shape of hearts. This seems a very
appropriate form for an object used to check hemorrhages.
The best effect was attained when the stone was
first dipped in cold water and then held by the patient
in his right hand. Of course the application of any cold
object would serve to congeal the blood, but the connection
with the heart vanishes in the direction to place the
stone in the <i>right</i> hand. Monardes states that both Spaniards
and Indians used the bloodstone in this way.<a id="FNanchor_509_509" href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></p>

<p>The Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun, a missionary
to the Mexican Indians, shortly after the Spanish
Conquest, writes that in 1576 he cured many natives who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
were at the point of death from hemorrhage, a result of
the plague, by causing them to hold in the hand a piece
of bloodstone. By this means he claims to have saved
many lives.<a id="FNanchor_510_510" href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></p>

<p>Robert Boyle, in his “Essay about the Origin and
Virtues of Gems” (London, 1672, pp. 177-78), tells of
a gentleman of his acquaintance who was “of a complexion
extraordinary sanguin,” and was much afflicted with
bleeding of the nose. A gentlewoman sent to him a bloodstone,
directing him to wear it suspended from his neck,
and from the time he put it on he was no longer troubled
with his malady. It recurred, however, if he removed
the stone. When Boyle objected that this might be a
result of imagination, his friend disposed of his objection
by relating the instance of a woman to whom the
stone had been applied when she was unconscious from
loss of blood. Nevertheless, as soon as it touched her,
the flow of blood was checked. Boyle states that this
stone did not seem to him to resemble a true bloodstone.
It may have been that the cold of the stone congealed
the blood, or that the flow was checked by exhaustion.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
